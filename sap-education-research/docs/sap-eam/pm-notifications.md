In **SAP EAM (Enterprise Asset Management)**, a **PM Notification** is the formal way to record and communicate an issue, malfunction, or maintenance requirement related to a technical object (like equipment, functional location, or asset).

üëâ **Creating a PM Notification** means generating a record in the system that captures details about a maintenance event or request.

* To **report malfunctions** or damage.
* To **request maintenance work** (corrective, preventive, predictive).
* To **document inspection findings**.
* To **track breakdowns** and downtime.
* To **initiate follow-up maintenance orders**.

   * Raised when a user notices a problem and requests maintenance.

   * Records activities carried out without creating a full work order.

   * Reports quality-related issues (sometimes integrated with QM).
