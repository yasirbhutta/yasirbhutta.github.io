## ✅ **What is the SAP Menu?**

In SAP GUI (Graphical User Interface), there are two main navigation menus:

1. **SAP Menu**

   * This is the *standard* menu for all users.
   * It shows all the transactions, reports, and activities available in the system, grouped by modules (e.g., Financial Accounting, Materials Management, HR, etc.).
   * It is like a full “library” of everything your user role is allowed to see.

2. **User Menu**

   * This is a *personalized* menu.
   * It only shows the transactions, reports, and activities assigned to your specific user role (e.g., via your roles in SU01/SUIM).
   * It is simpler and usually shows only what you need for your job.

## ✅ **How to Switch from User Menu to SAP Menu?**

When you log in to SAP, you normally see the **User Menu** by default.
To switch between them:

1. **Look at the toolbar in the SAP Easy Access screen.**
2. Click on:

   * **Menu** (in the top bar)
   * Or right-click in the navigation area.

3. You will see two buttons/icons:

   * **User Menu**
   * **SAP Menu**
4. Click **SAP Menu** to switch to the full standard menu.
5. Or click **User Menu** to go back.

✅ **Shortcut:**
You can also use the icons directly under the “Favorites” folder in the navigation tree. There will be a **“User Menu”** icon and a **“SAP Menu”** icon — just double-click.

## ✅ **Tip:**

If you want to see *both* menus at the same time, you can expand them one by one in the navigation tree. They will show up under the root node.

**Example:**

```
SAP Easy Access  
 ├── Favorites  
 ├── User Menu for <username>  
 ├── SAP Menu
```
