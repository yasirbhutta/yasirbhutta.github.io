## 🔎 Wildcards in SAP

### 1. **Asterisk (\*) → Multiple Characters**

* Works like “anything / any number of characters.”
* Example:

  * Search: `*Ali*`
  * Result: Finds **Ali Raza**, **Muhammad Ali**, **Khalid Ali Khan**

### 2. **Plus Sign (+) → Single Character**

* Works like “exactly one character.”
* Example:

  * Search: `M+hmad`
  * Result: Finds **Mohmad**, **Mehmad**, but not **Muhammad** (too many characters).

### 3. **Search Term with Wildcard**

* You can use wildcards with **Search Term fields** too.
* Example:

  * If Search Term = `BIC*` → it will show **BIC Training Hall 01**, **BIC Lab**, **BIC Seminar Room**.

---

## ⚙️ Where You Commonly Use Wildcards

* **Student Search** → when you don’t know full student name/ID.
* **Vendor/Customer Search** → partial vendor names.
* **Room/Resource Search** → e.g., `*Lab*` to list all labs.
* **Course Search** → e.g., `CSC*` for all Computer Science courses.

---

✅ **Best Practice for University Setup**

* Use **structured codes** with prefixes (e.g., `CSC101`, `BIC-LAB01`).
* Then, wildcard searches like `CSC*` or `BIC*` will bring neat results.

|                |                                  | `*Lab*`            | Finds all labs: Physics Lab, Computer Lab, BIC Lab         |
| `+` (plus)     | Exactly one character            | `M+hmad`           | Finds *Mohmad*, *Mehmad* but **not** *Muhammad*            |

| Combination    | Mix \* and + for precise results | `*ahm+d*`          | Finds *Ahmad*, *Rahmad*, *Shahmed*                         |
|                |                                  | `BIC-TRN0+`        | Finds *BIC-TRN01*, *BIC-TRN02*                             |

## 📌 Examples by University Use Case

### 1. **Student Search**

* Search: `*Yasir*` → Finds *Muhammad Yasir Bhutta*, *Yasir Khan*.
* Search: `20*` in **Student ID** → Finds all students admitted in 2020 batch.

### 2. **Course Search**

* Search: `CSC*` → Lists all Computer Science courses.
* Search: `ENG1*` → Lists all English Level 1 courses.

### 3. **Room / Resource Search**

* Search: `*Lab*` → Shows all labs (Computer Lab, Physics Lab, Engineering Lab).
* Search: `BIC*` → Shows all rooms in Business Incubation Centre.

### 4. **Faculty Search**

* Search: `Dr*` → Shows all faculty members starting with “Dr”.
* Search: `*Khan` → Shows all faculty members with surname “Khan”.

✅ **Tip for your staff**:

* Use **structured codes** (e.g., `BIC-TRN01`, `CSC101`) so that wildcard searches like `BIC*` or `CSC*` give organized results.
* Always use `*` when unsure about spelling.
