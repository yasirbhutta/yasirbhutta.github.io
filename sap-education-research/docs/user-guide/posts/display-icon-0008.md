## 📖 Display Icon in SAP GUI

---

## 1. Purpose

In SAP, the **Display icon** is used to open an object (course, program, student record, etc.) in **read-only mode**. This prevents accidental changes.

---

## 2. Icon Appearance

* The **Display icon** usually looks like **a pair of glasses 👓**.
* It’s located in the **standard toolbar** at the top of the SAP GUI window.

---

## 3. Usage

1. Select an item (e.g., a course, module, or student record).
2. Click the **Display (👓) icon** on the toolbar.

   * Alternatively, press **F7** (in many SAP screens).
3. The system opens the object in **Display mode** → you can view but not edit.

---

## 4. Related Icons

* **Change (✏️ pencil icon)** → Opens the object in edit mode.
* **Create (📄 star icon)** → Create a new object.
* **Display (👓 glasses icon)** → Read-only view.

---

✅ **Tip:** If you’re unsure whether you’re in *display* or *change* mode, check the **status bar** → it will say *Display Mode* or *Change Mode*.
