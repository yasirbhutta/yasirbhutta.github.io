## 🔹 **Business Event Type**

* Acts as a **template / category** for events.
* Defines **general, reusable attributes** such as:

  * Subject area (e.g., *“Math 101 Lecture”*)
  * Default duration (e.g., *2 hours*)
  * Target group / requirements
  * Standard capacity (min./max. participants)
  * Organizational assignment (department, program, etc.)
* No students are booked directly to the type — it’s only a framework.
* You can create **many events** from one type.

👉 Example: *“Computer Programming I (Lecture)”* as a **Business Event Type**.

## 🔹 **Business Event**

* Is the **real, scheduled instance** of a Business Event Type.
* Contains **concrete details** such as:

  * Date & Time (e.g., *Monday 10–12, Sep 15, 2025*)
  * Location / Room
  * Instructor
  * Specific capacity for that instance
* Students are booked/enrolled to **business events**, not to event types.
* Events inherit default settings from the type, but you can adjust them.

👉 Example: *“Computer Programming I (Lecture) – Section A – Fall 2025”* scheduled every Monday.

## 🔑 Difference in one line:

* **Business Event Type** = Template (defines *what* the event is).
* **Business Event** = Instance (defines *when/where/how* it actually happens).
