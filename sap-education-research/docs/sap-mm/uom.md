In **SAP**, a **measuring unit** (also called **unit of measure**, or **UoM**) is used to define **how quantities of materials are measured and managed** in business processes such as purchasing, inventory management, sales, and production.

### üîç What is a Measuring Unit in SAP?

A **measuring unit** (Unit of Measure - UoM) represents the **quantity basis** for transactions involving materials.

For example:

* 1 **PC** (piece)
* 5 **KG** (kilograms)
* 10 **L** (liters)
* 100 **M** (meters)

SAP supports multiple units for a single material (e.g., base unit, alternative units).
