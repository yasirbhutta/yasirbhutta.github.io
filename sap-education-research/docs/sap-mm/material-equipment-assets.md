In **SAP (Systems, Applications, and Products in Data Processing)**, the terms **Material**, **Equipment**, and **Asset** represent different types of business objects, each with distinct uses and characteristics. Here’s a clear comparison:

| **Term**      | **Definition**                                                                                                                 | **Usage**                                                                 | **Key SAP Module**                                                               |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Material**  | A general item used in procurement, production, inventory, or sales. It can be raw material, finished goods, etc.             | Inventory management, sales, procurement, production.                     | MM (Materials Management), SD (Sales and Distribution), PP (Production Planning) |
| **Equipment** | A physical, individual item that is maintained as a unique object (with a serial number) for tracking service and maintenance. | Maintenance, calibration, tracking the usage history of machines/devices. | PM (Plant Maintenance), CS (Customer Service)                                    |
| **Asset**     | A fixed asset like a building, machine, or vehicle that is capitalized and depreciated over time.                              | Financial accounting, asset tracking, depreciation.                       | FI-AA (Financial Accounting - Asset Accounting)                                  |

### Key Differences

| Feature                           | Material           | Equipment                                 | Asset                                |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Has inventory stock?**          | Yes                | No                                        | No                                   |
| **Can be purchased/sold?**        | Yes                | Sometimes (if it's spare part or product) | Rarely                               |
| **Individually tracked?**         | Only if serialized | Yes                                       | Yes                                  |
| **Depreciated over time?**        | No                 | No (unless also an asset)                 | Yes                                  |
| **Can be maintained (serviced)?** | No                 | Yes                                       | No (unless also linked to equipment) |

### Example Scenario

* **Material**: A laptop model (e.g., "Lenovo ThinkPad T14") in stock.
* **Equipment**: A specific laptop with serial number "SN12345" used by an employee and tracked for maintenance.
* **Asset**: The same laptop recorded as an asset in accounting books, being depreciated over 3 years.

## Key points:

1. Sometimes, a **material** can become both an **equipment** (if serialized) and an **asset** (if capitalized), depending on how it's used in the organization.
2. While all consumables are materials, not all materials are consumables — some are stock items, production components, or finished goods.
