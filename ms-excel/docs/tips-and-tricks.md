### Transpose (rotate) data from rows to columns or vice versa

Transposing data is the process of switching data from rows to columns or vice versa. This is often done to make the data easier to read or to improve the layout of a spreadsheet.

#### How to Transpose Data in Excel

## Flash Fill in Excel

Flash Fill is a feature in Excel that automatically fills in data based on patterns it recognizes in your existing data. It is a powerful tool that can save you a lot of time and effort, especially when working with large datasets.

**Tips:** 'CTRL+E' is the shortcut for Flash Fill.

Here are some examples of how to use Flash Fill:

**Extracting data from text:** For example, suppose you have a column of text that contains email addresses. You can use Flash Fill to extract the email addresses from the text and put them in a separate column.

**Combining text from multiple columns:** For example, suppose you have a list of first names in one column and a list of last names in another column. You can use Flash Fill to combine the first and last names into a single column.
