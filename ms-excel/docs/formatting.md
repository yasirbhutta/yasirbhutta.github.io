## Formatting Commands in Excel

### Font

- **A font is a collection of characters, symbols, and glyphs that share a common design and are used to display text in a specific style.** Fonts can be used for various purposes such as creating logos, designing websites, and publishing books.[^1]
- There are many different types of fonts available, each with its own unique personality. Some fonts are more formal and elegant, while others are more casual and fun. Some fonts are designed to be easy to read, while others are more decorative.
- Here are some examples of different types of fonts:

  - **Serif fonts** have small decorative lines at the ends of their strokes. They are often considered to be more formal and elegant than sans-serif fonts. Examples of serif fonts include `Times New Roman`, `Georgia`, and `Garamond`.
  - **Sans-serif fonts** do not have the decorative lines at the ends of their strokes. They are often considered to be more modern and casual than serif fonts. Examples of sans-serif fonts include `Arial`, `Helvetica`, and Futura.
  - **Script fonts** resemble handwritten text. They are often used for invitations, greeting cards, and other formal documents. Examples of script fonts include Brush Script, Calligraphy, and Freestyle Script.
  - **Decorative fonts** are designed to be eye-catching and decorative. They are often used for headlines, logos, and other graphic design elements. Examples of decorative fonts include `Comic Sans`, Trajan Pro, and Papyrus.

Fonts are used in Excel to change the style and size of text and characters in a document. Changing the font of your numbers and text in an Excel worksheet can help your document to look more appealing and, at times, make it easier for the reader to digest the information.

Excel provides users with a pre-selected font that they may use when creating workbooks. A default font can play an important role in your document’s appearance and reader comprehension

### Font Size

-The font size or text size is a number that measures the size of characters (such as letters, numbers, and punctuation marks) on a screen or printed page 1. In computing and web design, font sizes can be defined in units of pixels (px), points (pt), or ems (em).[^2]

- In Microsoft Excel, changing the font size of your numbers and text can help your document to look more appealing and make it easier for the reader to digest the information.

### Bold

- In Microsoft Excel, bold is a font style that makes text appear `thicker` and `darker` than the surrounding text.
- It is used to emphasize important information or to make headings stand out in a table or spreadsheet.

Keyboard shortcut: **Ctrl+B**.[^5]

### Italic

- In Microsoft Excel, Italic font style is a type of text formatting where the letters are `tilted to the right`. It is used to emphasize important information or to make headings stand out in a table or spreadsheet.

Keyboard shortcut: **Ctrl+I**.[^5]

### Underline

- In Microsoft Excel, underline is a font style that adds a `line below the text`.
- The underline command is used to draw attention to specific text or data in a table or spreadsheet. It can be used to indicate headings, subheadings, or important information that needs to be highlighted. Underlining can also be used for emphasis when bold or italic formatting is not appropriate.[^6]

Keyboard shortcut: **Ctrl+U**.[^5]

### Strikethrough

- In Microsoft Excel, strikethrough is a font style that `adds a line through the middle of the text`. 
- The strikethrough command is used to indicate that certain information is `no longer relevant` or has been `deleted`. It can also be used to `show completed tasks in a table or spreadsheet`.[^7]

Keyboard shortcut: **Ctrl+5**.[^5]
