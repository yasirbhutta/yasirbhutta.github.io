## Conditional Formatting

Conditional formatting is a feature in Microsoft Excel that allows you to highlight cells based on specific conditions. You can use it to make patterns and trends in your data more apparent. For example, you can use conditional formatting to highlight cells that contain values which meet a certain condition, such as cells that contain a value greater than 100.

## Data Validation

Data validation is a feature in Microsoft Excel that allows you to restrict the type of data or the values that users enter into a cell. You can use data validation to create a dropdown list, restrict the length of the text, or limit the cell to accept only whole numbers or decimal numbers, among other things.

## PivotTable

- PivotTable is a powerful feature in Microsoft Excel that allows you to summarize, analyze, and present data in a meaningful way.
- It enables you to extract insights from large datasets by creating a summary table that aggregates, groups, and filters data based on your requirements.

### Repeat specific rows or columns on every printed page

Repeating rows or columns on every printed page, also known as setting print titles, can be helpful when you have a large worksheet that spans multiple pages. This ensures that your headers or labels are always visible on each page, making it easier to read and understand your data.

### Set or clear a print area on a worksheet

A print area is one or more ranges of cells that you designate to print when you don't want to print the entire worksheet. When you print a worksheet after defining a print area, only the print area is printed. You can add cells to expand the print area as needed, and you can clear the print area to print the entire worksheet. [^1]

### Sort & Filter

Sorting in Excel is a process of arranging data in a specific order, either ascending or descending. It allows you to organize and analyze your data more effectively.

There are two main types of sorting in Excel:

**Sort by column:** This involves arranging data based on the values in a particular column. For instance, you can sort a list of names alphabetically or sort a list of numbers from smallest to largest.

**Sort by multiple columns:** This involves sorting data based on the values in multiple columns. For example, you can sort a list of customer records by country and then by city within each country.

Filtering allows you to display only the rows of data that meet certain criteria. For example, you could filter a table of student data to show only the students who have a grade of A.

Types of Filters in Excel

**Filter by value:** This is the most common type of filter, where you select specific values or ranges of values to display.

**Filter by format:** This filter allows you to show rows based on cell formatting, such as font color, cell color, or borders.

**Filter by custom criteria:** This filter provides more flexibility, enabling you to define complex criteria using logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) and comparisons (equal to, greater than, less than).
