- "######"
This error occurs when a column is not wide enough, or a negative date or time is used.
- "# DIV / O!"
A division by zero has occurred in the formula
- "# N / A"
A value is not available to the formula
- "# Name"
An unrecognizable range name is used in the formula
"# Value!"
An incorrect argument or operator is used in the formula
- "# Ref"
An invalid cell is referenced in the formula

- #N/A

**Note:** You can enter #N/A in those cells where data is not yet available. Formulas that refer to those cells will then return #N/A instead of attempting to calculate a value.
