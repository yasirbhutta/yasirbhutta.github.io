#### COUNT

- The COUNT function counts the number of cells that contain numbers, and counts numbers within the list of arguments. 
- Use the COUNT function to get the number of entries in a number field that is in a range or array of numbers.

For example, you can enter the following formula to count the numbers in the range A1:A20: =COUNT(A1:A20). In this example, if five of the cells in the range contain numbers, the result is 5.
