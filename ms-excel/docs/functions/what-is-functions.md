# Functions

- Excel has hundreds of predefined formulae known as Functions
- Functions use specific `arguments` in a particular order or structure
  - The arguments of functions can be anything from numbers, text, logical values, or cell references
  - You can also have formulae or other functions as arguments in a function that are called nested functions.

Functions ….
The normal order for a function is:-

- `Function Name`,
- The opening `parenthesis (`
- `Arguments` for the function separated by commas and `closing parenthesis )`.


Here’s an improved and more beginner-friendly version of your content about **Excel Functions**:

# **Excel Functions for Beginners**  

## **What Are Functions?**  

Functions are predefined formulas that perform calculations by using specific values, called arguments, in a particular order, or structure. These functions help you perform calculations, analyze data, and automate tasks quickly. 

## **How Do Functions Work?**  
Functions follow a specific structure:  

1. **Function Name** – The type of calculation you want to perform (e.g., `SUM`, `AVERAGE`).  
2. **Opening Parenthesis `(`** – Starts the function’s arguments.  
3. **Arguments** – The inputs the function needs to work. These can be:  
   - Numbers  
   - Text  
   - Cell references (e.g., `A1`, `B2:B10`)  
   - Other functions (called **nested functions**)  
4. **Closing Parenthesis `)`** – Ends the function.  

### **Example:**  
`=SUM(A1:A5)`  
- `SUM` → Function name  
- `(A1:A5)` → Argument (adds values from cells A1 to A5)  

### **Nested Functions**  
You can use a function **inside another function** for more complex calculations.  

**Example:**  
`=AVERAGE(SUM(B2:B5), C2)`  
- First, `SUM(B2:B5)` adds the values in B2 to B5.  
- Then, `AVERAGE` calculates the mean of that sum and cell C2.
