#### Concat function - Combine text from two or more cells into one cell

- The CONCAT function combines the text from multiple ranges and/or strings, but it doesn't provide delimiter or IgnoreEmpty arguments.

CONCAT(text1, [text2],â€¦)
```

For example, =CONCAT("The"," ","sun"," ","will"," ","come"," ","up"," ","tomorrow.") will return The sun will come up tomorrow.
