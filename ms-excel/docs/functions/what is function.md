# Functions

- Excel has hundreds of predefined formulae known as Functions
- Functions use specific `arguments` in a particular order or structure
  - The arguments of functions can be anything from numbers, text, logical values, or cell references
  - You can also have formulae or other functions as arguments in a function that are called nested functions.

Functions â€¦.
The normal order for a function is:-

- `Function Name`,
- The opening `parenthesis (`
- `Arguments` for the function separated by commas and `closing parenthesis )`.
