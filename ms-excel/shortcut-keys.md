If you don't know which function to use, select the cell you want to put it in, and then press SHIFT+F3.
The Paste Function dialog box appears with a list to choose from. The available functions are categorized and have descriptions.
If you know the name of the function, but don't know details such as what arguments it can take, you can use the Formula Palette. Type =function in a cell (where function is the name of the function) and then press CTRL+A.
For example type =LEFT in a cell and then press CTRL+A.
 
In the Formula Palette, press TAB and SHIFT+TAB to move between the boxes, and ENTER when you are done. Or press ESC to discard any changes.
If you know the name of the function, and remember some of the details, but just need a reminder, type =function in a cell, and then press CTRL+SHIFT+A.
The arguments of the function are inserted into the cell, and you can type over them.
