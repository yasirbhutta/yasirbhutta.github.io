This assignment will help you practice using basic Excel functions and formatting to analyze sales data.

**Scenario:** You are a sales manager for a company that sells electronics. You are provided with a spreadsheet containing sales data for the past quarter. Your task is to analyze this data and answer some questions to gain insights into sales performance.

**Sample Sheet:**

|---|---|---|---|
| **Product** | **Quantity Sold** | **Unit Price** | **Total Sales** |
| Laptop A | 25 | $800 |  =B2*C2  | 
| Laptop B | 18 | $1000 |  =B3*C3  |
| Phone X | 30 | $500 |  =B4*C4  |
| Phone Y | 12 | $700 |  =B5*C5  |
| Monitor Z | 15 | $200 |  =B6*C6  |

**Instructions:**

1. **Complete the "Total Sales" column:** Use the appropriate formula to calculate the total sales for each product by multiplying the quantity sold (column B) by the unit price (column C).
2. **Calculate Total Sales:** Use the SUM function to calculate the total sales for all products. 
3. **Find the Top-Selling Product:** Use conditional formatting to highlight the row with the highest total sales. 
4. **Calculate Average Unit Price:** Use the AVERAGE function to calculate the average unit price across all products.

6. **Create a Chart:**  Create a bar chart to visualize total sales for each product.

**Optional:**

* Use data validation to ensure only valid data is entered in the "Quantity Sold" and "Unit Price" columns.

**Deliverables:**
