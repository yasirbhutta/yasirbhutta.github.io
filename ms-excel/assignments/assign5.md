# Excel Sheet Assignment: Task Planner

- [Download PDF](assign5.pdf)  

1. **Open a New Excel Workbook**:
   - Start by opening a new Excel workbook on your computer. This will provide you with a blank canvas to create your assignment sheet.

2. **Rename the Sheet**:
   - By default, Excel creates a sheet named "Sheet1." It's a good idea to rename it to something more descriptive like "Assignment Sheet." To do this:
     - Double-click on the sheet name (located at the bottom left corner of the workbook).
     - Type in the new name and press Enter.

3. **Format the Cells**:
   - Next, format the cells to organize the assignment details, due dates, and status updates. Here's how:
     - **Column A**: Assignment Names
     - **Column B**: Due Dates
     - **Column C**: Status (e.g., Not Started, In Progress, Completed)
     - You can adjust the column widths as needed.

4. **Enter Assignment Details**:
   - In the "Assignment Names" column (Column A), list the names of the assignments.
   - In the "Due Dates" column (Column B), enter the due dates for each assignment.
   - In the "Status" column (Column C), you can use drop-down menus or simply type the status (e.g., "Not Started," "In Progress," "Completed").

5. **Conditional Formatting (Optional)**:
   - To make the assignment sheet visually appealing, consider using conditional formatting:
     - Highlight late assignments in red.
     - Change the cell color based on the status (e.g., green for completed, yellow for in progress).
     - You can access conditional formatting under the "Home" tab in Excel.

6. **Additional Columns (Optional)**:
   - Depending on your needs, you can add more columns:
     - **Column D**: Points/Grades (if you want to track scores)
     - **Column E**: Notes (for additional comments or instructions)
