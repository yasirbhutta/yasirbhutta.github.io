# Excel Sheet Assignment: Budget Planner

This assignment will help you practice creating a budget using Excel formulas and formatting.

**Scenario:** You are planning your monthly budget. You want to track your income and expenses to ensure you don't overspend.

**Instructions:**

1. **Create a Spreadsheet:** Open a new Excel spreadsheet.
2. **Headers:** In the first row, create column headers for:
    - **Category:** This will list your income and expense categories (e.g., Salary, Rent, Groceries, Entertainment).
    - **Amount:** This will hold the numerical value for each category.
3. **Income:**
    - List your income sources in a few rows under "Category" (e.g., Salary, Part-time Job).
    - Enter the expected amount you will receive for each income source in the "Amount" column.
4. **Expenses:**
    - List your typical expense categories under "Category" (e.g., Rent, Utilities, Groceries, Transportation). 
    - Leave some rows blank for additional expenses you might incur.
5. **Formulas:**
    - In the "Amount" column for your total income, use a formula to sum all your individual income amounts. (e.g., use the SUM function)
    - In the "Amount" column for each expense category, enter the estimated amount you plan to spend on that category. 
    - Create a formula in a separate cell to calculate your total expenses by summing all the individual expense amounts. (e.g., use the SUM function)
6. **Difference:** Create a formula in another cell to calculate the difference between your total income and total expenses. This will show you if you have a surplus (positive) or deficit (negative) in your budget.
7. **Formatting:** 
    - Use bold font for the headers and total labels.
    - Apply currency formatting to the "Amount" column.
    - Use conditional formatting to highlight cells with negative values (expenses exceeding income).
8. **Chart:**
    - Add a pie chart to visualize the breakdown of your income and expenses.

**Submission:**

* Save your completed spreadsheet as "Budget_YourName.xlsx"
* Submit the spreadsheet to your instructor.
