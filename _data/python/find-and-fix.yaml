        difficulty: easy
        prompt: |
          Fix the invalid variable name:
        code: |
          global-var = 10
          print(global-var)
        hint: Python variable names cannot contain hyphens.
        issue: Hyphens are interpreted as subtraction operators.
        solution: |
          global_var = 10
          print(global_var)

        difficulty: easy
        prompt: |
          Fix the variable assignment error:
        code: |
          print(message)
          message = "Hello"
        hint: Variables must be defined before use.
        issue: Trying to access `message` before assignment.
        solution: |
          message = "Hello"
          print(message)

      - id: dyn-fix-001
        difficulty: medium
        prompt: |
          Fix the type confusion bug:
        code: |
          price = "10"
          total = price * 2
          print(total)  # Outputs "1010" (unexpected)
        hint: Strings and numbers behave differently with `*`.
        issue: Dynamic typing allows the operation but produces undesired string concatenation.
        solution: |
          price = 10  # or int("10")
          total = price * 2
          print(total)  # Outputs 20

      - id: dyn-fix-002
        difficulty: hard
        prompt: |
          Fix the dynamic typing pitfall:
        code: |
          def add(a, b):
              return a + b
          
          print(add(5, 3))     # 8
          print(add("5", "3")) # "53" (unexpected for numbers)
        hint: The `+` operator has different behaviors per type.
        issue: Function works differently with strings vs numbers.
        solution: |
          def add(a, b):
              return int(a) + int(b)

      - id: none-fix-001
        difficulty: easy
        prompt: |
          Fix the None comparison:
        code: |
          result = None
          if result == None:  # Works but non-idiomatic
              print("Empty")
        hint: Python has a dedicated operator for `None` checks.
        issue: Should use identity comparison (`is`) for `None`.
        solution: |
          result = None
          if result is None:
              print("Empty")

      - id: none-fix-002
        difficulty: medium
        prompt: |
          Fix the None-related crash:
        code: |
          def get_user():
              return None
          
          user = get_user()
          print(user.upper())  # AttributeError
        hint: Methods can't be called on `None`.
        issue: Attempting to call `.upper()` on a `None` value.
        solution: |
          def get_user():
              return None
          
          user = get_user()
          if user is not None:
              print(user.upper())
          else:
              print("No user found")

        hint: Direct access to attributes violates encapsulation principles.

        hint: Both attributes need protection and grades should have controlled modification.

        hint: Both the items list and total should be protected from direct modification.
