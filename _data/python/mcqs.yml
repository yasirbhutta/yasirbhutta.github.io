        question: What is the main purpose of inheritance in Python?
        options:
          - To create multiple objects of a class
          - To reuse code and extend functionality
          - To define private methods in a class
          - To create a new programming paradigm
        answer: To reuse code and extend functionality
        explanation: Inheritance allows code reuse and method overriding in child classes.

        question: Which of the following is the correct syntax for inheritance in Python?
        options:
          - "class Child inherits Parent:"
          - "class Child(Parent):"
          - "class Parent -> Child:"
          - "class Parent(Child):"
        answer: "class Child(Parent):"
        explanation: In Python, a child class is defined using the syntax `class Child(Parent):`, where `Child` inherits from `Parent`.

        question: What is the output of the following code?
        code: |
          class Animal:
              def speak(self):
                  print("Animal speaks")

          class Dog(Animal):
              pass

          d = Dog()
          d.speak()
        options:
          - Animal speaks
          - Dog speaks
          - "Error: **speak()** not defined"
          - Nothing
        answer: Animal speaks
        explanation: Dog inherits the `speak()` method from Animal.

        question: What is the output of the following code?
        code: |
          class Parent:
              def __init__(self):
                  print("Parent constructor")

          class Child(Parent):
              def __init__(self):
                  print("Child constructor")

          c = Child()
        options:
          - Parent constructor
          - Child constructor
          - Parent constructor Child constructor
          - Error
        answer: Child constructor
        explanation: The `Child` constructor overrides the `Parent` constructor.

        question: What is the output of the following code?
        code: |
          class Parent:
              def show(self):

          class Child(Parent):
              def show(self):
                  print("Child")

          obj = Child()
          obj.show()
        options:
          - Parent
          - Child
          - Parent Child
          - Error

        difficulty: medium
        question: What is polymorphism in Python?
        options:
          - Inheritance of attributes from a class
          - The ability of different classes to provide different implementations of the same method
          - The process of creating objects from a class
          - None of the above
        answer: The ability of different classes to provide different implementations of the same method
        explanation: Polymorphism allows methods to be defined in multiple classes with different implementations.

        question: Which function is used to determine the type of an object in Python?
        options:
          - type()
          - isinstance()
          - object()
          - None of the above
        answer: type()
        explanation: The `type()` function is used to determine the type of an object in Python.
