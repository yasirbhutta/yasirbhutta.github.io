        question: What is encapsulation in Python OOP?
        options:
          - "A way to hide internal implementation details and expose only necessary features"
          - "A method to combine multiple functions into one"
          - "A technique to make code run faster"
          - "A way to remove unused variables"
        answer: "A way to hide internal implementation details and expose only necessary features"
        explanation: Encapsulation helps in restricting access to certain components and prevents unintended modifications.

        question: How do you make an attribute private in Python?
        options:
          - "By using the `private` keyword"
          - "By prefixing the attribute name with a single underscore `_`"
          - "By prefixing the attribute name with double underscores `__`"
          - "By using the `hidden` keyword"
        answer: "By prefixing the attribute name with double underscores `__`"
        explanation: In Python, double underscores `__` make an attribute name-mangled, restricting direct access.

        question: What is the purpose of getter and setter methods in encapsulation?
        options:
          - "To directly modify private attributes"
          - "To control access and modification of private attributes"
          - "To delete unused variables"
          - "To improve code execution speed"
        answer: "To control access and modification of private attributes"
        explanation: Getters and setters allow controlled access to private attributes, enabling validation or modification checks.

        question: Which of the following is true about name mangling in Python?
        options:

          - "It renames the attribute to `_ClassName__attribute`"
          - "It deletes the attribute after use"
          - "It is done using the `@mangle` decorator"
        answer: "It renames the attribute to `_ClassName__attribute`"
        explanation: Name mangling changes the attribute name to `_ClassName__attribute` to avoid accidental access.

          - "None"
          - "0"

        question: What is the correct way to access a private attribute from outside its class?
        options:

          - "By using a getter method"
          - "By using `object.__attribute`"
        answer: "By using a getter method"
        explanation: The safest way is to use a getter method (e.g., `get_balance()`) instead of direct access.

          - "`@getter`"

        question: What is the purpose of the single underscore `_` before a variable name?
        options:
          - "It makes the variable private"
          - "It indicates that the variable is for internal use (convention)"
          - "It makes the variable global"
          - "It prevents the variable from being modified"
        answer: "It indicates that the variable is for internal use (convention)."
        explanation: A single underscore is a naming convention to suggest that a variable is for internal use (not enforced by Python). It should be accessed only within the class or its subclasses.

        answer: |
          Hello from Child
          Hello from Parent
          Hello from Parent
        explanation: |
          The `Child.greet()` method prints "Hello from Child", then explicitly calls `Parent.greet(self)` and `super().greet()`, both of which call the `Parent` class's `greet()` method, resulting in "Hello from Parent" printed twice.

        question: What is the main purpose of inheritance in Python?
        options:
          - To create multiple objects of a class
          - To reuse code and extend functionality
          - To define private methods in a class
          - To create a new programming paradigm
        answer: To reuse code and extend functionality
