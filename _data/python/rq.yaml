        prompt: What is inheritance in Python?
        answer: Inheritance in Python allows a class (child class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent class), promoting code reusability and creating a hierarchical relationship between classes.

        prompt: How does Python handle method resolution order (MRO) in the case of multiple inheritance?
        answer: Python uses the C3 Linearization algorithm to determine the method resolution order (MRO) when multiple inheritance is involved. This ensures that methods are called in a consistent order, from left to right in the class hierarchy.

        prompt: What happens if a subclass does not override a method from the parent class?
        answer: If a subclass does not override a method, the child class inherits the method from the parent class and can use it as-is without any modification.

        prompt: Why would you use the super() function in a subclass constructor?
        answer: The super() function is used in a subclass constructor to call the parent class's constructor (__init__), ensuring that the parent class’s attributes are initialized properly in the child class.

        prompt: Can a child class in Python access private attributes of the parent class?
        answer: No, private attributes in Python (those prefixed with __) are name-mangled and are not directly accessible in the child class or outside the parent class.

        prompt: What is the difference between method overriding and method overloading in Python?
        answer: Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in the parent class. Python does not support method overloading in the traditional sense, but method overloading can be simulated using default or variable-length arguments.

        prompt: In the case of a class hierarchy, which of the following will be true about the child class's constructor (__init__ method)?
        answer: The parent class's constructor is not automatically called unless explicitly invoked using super(). If the child class defines its own constructor, it can call super().__init__() to invoke the parent class’s constructor and initialize the inherited attributes.
