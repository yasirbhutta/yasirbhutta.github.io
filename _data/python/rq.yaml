        prompt: "What are the differences between break, continue, and pass in while loops?"
        answer: >
          - break: Immediately exits the entire loop
          - continue: Skips the rest of current iteration and jumps to next condition check
          - pass: Does nothing (placeholder for empty blocks)
          The else clause executes only if the loop completes normally (no break).
        examples:
          - "break: `while True: if condition: break`"
          - "continue: `while x > 0: x -= 1; if x%2: continue; print(x)`"
          - "pass: `while condition: pass  # TODO: implement later`"

        prompt: "What are the loop control statements (break, continue, else) and how do they work?"
        answer: >
          break: Immediately exits the entire loop
          continue: Skips the current iteration and moves to the next
          else: Executes after the loop completes normally (only if no break occurred)
          These statements help customize loop behavior and handle special cases.
        examples:
          - "break: `for num in nums: if num == 0: break`"
          - "continue: `for num in nums: if num%2==0: continue`"
          - "else: `for n in range(2,10): ... else: print('All primes checked')`"

  - topic: loops-while
    questions:
      - id: while-review-001
        prompt: "What are the basic components and syntax of a Python while loop?"
        answer: >
          A Python while loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as its condition remains True.
          The basic syntax is: `while condition:` followed by an indented block of code.
          The loop continues until the condition evaluates to False or a break statement is encountered.
        examples:
          - "Basic loop: `count = 0`\n`while count < 5: print(count); count += 1`"
          - "Infinite loop: `while True: print('Running...')`"

      - id: while-review-002
        prompt: "How do you prevent and handle infinite while loops?"
        answer: >
          To prevent infinite loops:
          1. Ensure the loop condition will eventually become False
          2. Include a way to modify the condition variable within the loop
          3. Use break statements with clear exit conditions
          4. Consider adding a maximum iteration count as a safeguard
        examples:
          - "Safe counter: `max_attempts = 3`\n`attempts = 0`\n`while attempts < max_attempts: ...`"
          - "User input exit: `while True: if input('Quit? ') == 'y': break`"

      - id: while-review-004
        prompt: "When should you use a while loop versus a for loop in Python?"
        answer: >
          Use while loops when:
          - You don't know the number of iterations in advance
          - You need to loop until a condition changes
          - You're waiting for external events (e.g., user input)
          Use for loops when:
          - You need to iterate over a known sequence
          - You need a specific number of iterations
          - You're processing each item in a collection
        examples:
          - "while: `while server_is_running: process_requests()`"
          - "for: `for item in collection: process(item)`"

        prompt: "What is the purpose and behavior of the else clause in while loops?"
        answer: >
          The else clause in while loops:
          - Executes only if the loop condition becomes False (normal termination)
          - Does not execute if the loop exits via break
          - Useful for search loops where you want to handle both found and not-found cases
          - Provides cleaner alternative to flag variables
        examples:
          - "Search loop: `while items: item = items.pop()`\n`if match(item): break`\n`else: print('Not found')`"

      - id: while-review-006
        prompt: "How can you implement common patterns like counters, input validation, and event loops using while?"
        answer: >
          Common while loop patterns:
          1. Counters: Initialize variable, condition checks limit, increment in loop
          2. Input validation: Loop until valid input received
          3. Event loops: while True with break conditions
          4. Sentinel values: Loop until special value encountered
        examples:
          - "Counter: `count = 0`\n`while count < 10: print(count); count += 1`"
          - "Input: `while True: age = input('Age? ')`\n`if age.isdigit(): break`"
          - "Event: `while not shutdown_event.is_set(): process_events()`"

    questions:
      - id: for-review-001
        prompt: "What are the basic components and syntax of a Python for loop?"
        answer: >
          A Python for loop iterates over items in any sequence (list, tuple, string, etc.) or other iterable object.
          The basic syntax is: `for item in iterable:` followed by an indented block of code.
          The loop variable (item) takes each value from the iterable in sequence.
        examples:
          - "Basic loop: `for fruit in ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']: print(fruit)`"
          - "With range: `for i in range(5): print(i)`"

      - id: for-review-002
        prompt: "How does the range() function work with for loops?"
        answer: >
          The range() function generates a sequence of numbers, commonly used for looping a specific number of times.
          It can take 1-3 arguments: start (inclusive), stop (exclusive), and step size.
          range() is memory efficient as it generates numbers on demand rather than storing them all.
        examples:
          - "range(5) → 0, 1, 2, 3, 4"
          - "range(2, 6) → 2, 3, 4, 5"
          - "range(0, 10, 2) → 0, 2, 4, 6, 8"

      - id: for-review-004
        prompt: "What are some common iterables used with for loops?"
        answer: >
          Common iterables include:
          - Sequences: lists, tuples, strings
          - Dictionaries (iterates over keys by default)
          - Sets
          - File objects (iterates lines)
          - Generator expressions
          - range() objects
          Any object implementing the iterator protocol can be used.
        examples:
          - "String: `for char in 'hello': ...`"
          - "Dictionary: `for key in my_dict:` or `for key, value in my_dict.items():`"
          - "File: `for line in open('file.txt'): ...`"

        prompt: "What are nested loops and what are their common use cases?"
        answer: >
          Nested loops are loops within loops, where each iteration of the outer loop triggers a complete run of the inner loop.
          Common uses include:
          - Processing multi-dimensional data (matrices, tables)
          - Generating combinations/permutations
          - Comparing all elements between collections
          - Implementing algorithms like bubble sort
        examples:
          - "Matrix processing: `for row in matrix: for cell in row: ...`"
          - "Combinations: `for x in range(3): for y in range(3): print(x,y)`"

        prompt: "What are list comprehensions and how do they relate to for loops?"
        answer: >
          List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists by applying an expression to each item in an iterable.
          They are essentially a compact syntax for transforming one list into another using a for loop.
          They can include conditional logic and multiple for clauses (nested loops).
        examples:
          - "Basic: `squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]`"
          - "With condition: `evens = [x for x in nums if x%2==0]`"
          - "Nested: `pairs = [(x,y) for x in range(3) for y in range(3)]`"

  - topic: tuples
    questions:
      - id: tuple-review-001
        prompt: "What are the key characteristics of Python tuples?"
        answer: >
          Tuples are ordered, immutable sequences that can contain elements of different types. 
          They are created with parentheses or just commas, and support operations like indexing and slicing.
        examples:
          - "Creation: `my_tuple = (1, 'a', 3.14)` or `my_tuple = 1, 'a', 3.14`"
          - "Single element: `single = (1,)` (note the comma)"

      - id: tuple-review-002
        prompt: "How does tuple slicing work in Python?"
        answer: >
          Tuple slicing uses the same syntax as list slicing: `tuple[start:stop:step]`. 
          It returns a new tuple containing elements from start (inclusive) to stop (exclusive), 
          with an optional step value.
        examples:
          - "Basic slice: `(1, 2, 3, 4)[1:3]` → `(2, 3)`"
          - "With step: `(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)[::2]` → `(1, 3, 5)`"

      - id: tuple-review-003
        prompt: "What are the main methods available for tuples?"
        answer: >
          Tuples have two main methods: 
          1. `count(x)` - returns the number of times x appears in the tuple
          2. `index(x)` - returns the first index where x appears
          They also support all common sequence operations.
        examples:
          - "Count: `(1, 2, 2, 3).count(2)` → `2`"
          - "Index: `('a', 'b', 'c').index('b')` → `1`"

      - id: tuple-review-004
        prompt: "Why would you choose a tuple over a list in Python?"
        answer: >
          Tuples are preferred when:
          1. You need an immutable sequence
          2. You want to use the sequence as a dictionary key
          3. Slightly better performance for iteration
          4. When the sequence has fixed meaning (like coordinates)
        examples:
          - "Dictionary key: `locations = {(1, 2): 'New York', (3, 4): 'London'}`"
          - "Fixed data: `color_rgb = (255, 0, 0)` for red"

      - id: tuple-review-005
        prompt: "How can you concatenate or repeat tuples?"
        answer: >
          Tuples support concatenation with `+` and repetition with `*` operators, 
          similar to strings and lists. Both operations return new tuples.
        examples:
          - "Concatenation: `(1, 2) + (3, 4)` → `(1, 2, 3, 4)`"
          - "Repetition: `('a', 'b') * 3` → `('a', 'b', 'a', 'b', 'a', 'b')`"

  - topic: if-elif-else
    questions:
      - id: cond-review-001
        prompt: "What is the purpose of the 'if' statement in Python?"
        answer: "The 'if' statement is used for conditional execution. It evaluates a condition and executes its block of code only if the condition is True."
        examples:
          - "Basic if: `if x > 0: print('Positive')`"
          - "With variable: `if logged_in: print('Welcome')`"

      - id: cond-review-002
        prompt: "When should you use 'elif' instead of separate 'if' statements?"
        answer: "'elif' should be used when checking multiple exclusive conditions where only one block should execute. Separate 'if' statements check independently and multiple blocks could execute."
        examples:
          - "Good (exclusive): `if grade >= 90: ... elif grade >= 80: ...`"
          - "Bad (non-exclusive): `if x > 0: ... if x < 10: ...` (both could run)"

      - id: cond-review-003
        prompt: "What is the purpose of the 'else' clause in conditionals?"
        answer: "The 'else' clause provides a default block of code that executes when all preceding 'if' and 'elif' conditions evaluate to False."
        examples:
          - "Basic else: `if x > 0: ... else: print('Not positive')`"
          - "After elif: `if x > 0: ... elif x < 0: ... else: print('Zero')`"

        prompt: "What is a nested conditional and when would you use one?"
        answer: "A nested conditional is an 'if' statement inside another 'if' statement. It's used when you need to check additional conditions only after a primary condition is met."
        examples:
          - "Basic nesting: `if x > 0: if x % 2 == 0: print('Positive even')`"
          - "Login system: `if user_exists: if password_correct: ...`"

        prompt: "How does Python determine which block to execute in an if-elif-else chain?"
        answer: "Python evaluates conditions from top to bottom. It executes the first block where the condition is True, skips all remaining conditions, and executes the 'else' block only if all conditions were False."
        examples:
          - "Order matters: `if x > 10: ... elif x > 5: ...` (second won't run if x=12)"
          - "Only one executes: `if True: ... elif True: ...` (second never reached)"

        prompt: "What are some common mistakes beginners make with Python conditionals?"
        answer: |
          Common mistakes include:
          1. Forgetting colons after conditions
          2. Using assignment (=) instead of comparison (==)
          3. Incorrect indentation of blocks
          4. Over-nesting conditionals unnecessarily
          5. Not covering all possible cases
        examples:
          - "Syntax error: `if x > 0 print('Positive')` (missing colon)"
          - "Logical error: `if x = 5: ...` (assignment not comparison)"

        prompt: "How can you test multiple conditions in a single 'if' statement?"
        answer: "Use logical operators: 'and' (both true), 'or' (either true), 'not' (inverse). Parentheses can group conditions for clarity and proper evaluation order."
        examples:
          - "AND: `if x > 0 and x < 10: ...`"
          - "OR: `if x == 'yes' or x == 'y': ...`"

  - topic: oop-inheritance
    questions:
      - id: py-rq-001
        prompt: What is inheritance in Python?
        answer: Inheritance in Python allows a class (child class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent class), promoting code reusability and creating a hierarchical relationship between classes.
        resources:
          - name: Learn about Inheritance in Python

      - id: py-rq-002
        prompt: How does Python handle method resolution order (MRO) in the case of multiple inheritance?
        answer: Python uses the C3 Linearization algorithm to determine the method resolution order (MRO) when multiple inheritance is involved. This ensures that methods are called in a consistent order, from left to right in the class hierarchy.

        prompt: What happens if a subclass does not override a method from the parent class?

      - id: py-rq-004
        prompt: Why would you use the super() function in a subclass constructor?
        answer: The super() function is used in a subclass constructor to call the parent class's constructor (__init__), ensuring that the parent class’s attributes are initialized properly in the child class.

      - id: py-rq-005
        prompt: Can a child class in Python access private attributes of the parent class?
        answer: No, private attributes in Python (those prefixed with __) are name-mangled and are not directly accessible in the child class or outside the parent class.

      - id: py-rq-006
        prompt: What is the difference between method overriding and method overloading in Python?
        answer: Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in the parent class. Python does not support method overloading in the traditional sense, but method overloading can be simulated using default or variable-length arguments.

        prompt: In the case of a class hierarchy, which of the following will be true about the child class's constructor (__init__ method)?
        answer: The parent class's constructor is not automatically called unless explicitly invoked using super(). If the child class defines its own constructor, it can call super().__init__() to invoke the parent class’s constructor and initialize the inherited attributes.
