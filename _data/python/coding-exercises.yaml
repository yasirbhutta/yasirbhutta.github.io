        title: "Basic Inheritance"
        task: |
          Create a `Vehicle` class with attributes like `brand` and `year`. Then, create a `Car` class that inherits from `Vehicle` and adds an additional attribute `model`.
        requirements: |
          - Define a method in the `Vehicle` class that prints basic vehicle details.
          - Override this method in the `Car` class to print additional details (e.g., model).
        input: |
          car = Car("Toyota", 2022, "Corolla")
          car.display_info()
        output: |
          Brand: Toyota, Year: 2022
          Model: Corolla

        title: "Method Overriding"
        task: |
          Create a `Person` class with a method `greet()`. Then, create a `Student` class that inherits from `Person` and overrides the `greet()` method to display a custom greeting message.
        requirements: |
          - The `Person` class should have a `name` attribute.
          - The `Student` class should override the `greet()` method to say "Hello, I am [name], a student".
        input: |
          student = Student("Alice")
          student.greet()
        output: |
          Hello, I am Alice, a student.

        title: "Using `super()` in Inheritance"
        task: |
          Create a `Shape` class with a method `area()` that returns `None`. Then, create a `Rectangle` class that inherits from `Shape` and calculates the area of the rectangle using the length and width. Use `super()` to call the `Shape` constructor.
        requirements: |
          - The `Rectangle` class should accept `length` and `width` as arguments.
          - The `area()` method in `Rectangle` should calculate and print the area of the rectangle.
        input: |
          rectangle = Rectangle(5, 3)
          print(f"Area of rectangle: {rectangle.area()}")
        output: |
          Area of rectangle: 15

        title: "Multilevel Inheritance"
        task: |
          Create a class `Animal` with a method `sound()`. Then, create a `Dog` class that inherits from `Animal` and overrides the `sound()` method. Afterward, create a `Puppy` class that inherits from `Dog` and adds a new method `play()`.
        requirements: |
          - The `sound()` method should print a generic animal sound in the `Animal` class.
          - The `Puppy` class should print a playful message in the `play()` method.
        input: |
          puppy = Puppy()
          puppy.sound()  # Inherited from Dog
          puppy.play()   # Specific to Puppy
        output: |
          Bark!
          Puppy is playing!

        title: "Hierarchical Inheritance"
        task: |
          Create a `Person` class with a method `info()` to display basic information. Then, create two classes `Employee` and `Student` that inherit from `Person` and override the `info()` method to show their specific details.
        requirements: |
          - The `Employee` class should display "Employee [name], [age], [position]".
          - The `Student` class should display "Student [name], [age], [major]".
        input: |
          emp = Employee("John", 30, "Software Engineer")
          emp.info()

          stu = Student("Jane", 20, "Computer Science")
          stu.info()
        output: |
          Employee John, Age: 30, Position: Software Engineer
          Student Jane, Age: 20, Major: Computer Science

        title: "Dynamic Method Resolution Order (MRO)"
        task: |
          Create a `Bird` class, a `FlyingBird` class, and a `Penguin` class. The `Penguin` class should inherit from `Bird` and override the `fly()` method to indicate that penguins can't fly.
        requirements: |
          - Use the `super()` function to call methods from the `Bird` class, demonstrating method resolution order (MRO).
        input: |
          bird = Bird()
          bird.fly()

          flying_bird = FlyingBird()
          flying_bird.fly()

          penguin = Penguin()
          penguin.fly()
        output: |
          Bird is flying.
          Flying bird is soaring high.
          Penguins cannot fly.
