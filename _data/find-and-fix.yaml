          Identify and fix the mistake in the following code:
          ```python
          class Father:
              def __init__(self, name):
                  name = name

          class Child(Father):
              pass

          c = Child("Ali")
          print(c.name)
          ```
        issue: The constructor assigns the parameter to itself instead of using `self.name = name`.
        solution: |
          ```python
          class Father:
              def __init__(self, name):
                  self.name = name
          ```

          Identify and fix the mistake in the following code:
          ```python
          class Animal:
              def sound():
                  print("Some sound")

          class Dog(Animal):
              pass

          d = Dog()
          d.sound()
          ```
        issue: Method `sound()` is missing the `self` parameter.
        solution: |
          ```python
          class Animal:
              def sound(self):
                  print("Some sound")
          ```

          Identify and fix the mistake in the following code:
          ```python
          class Person:
              def __init__(self, name):
                  self.name = name

          class Student(Person):
              def __init__(self, school):
                  self.school = school
          ```
        issue: Child constructor does not call the parent constructor, missing initialization of `name`.
        solution: |
          ```python
          class Student(Person):
              def __init__(self, name, school):
                  super().__init__(name)
                  self.school = school
          ```
