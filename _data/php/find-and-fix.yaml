              echo "My boat is " . $coLOR . "<br>";
          ?>
        hint: Variable names are case-sensitive in PHP.

          Identify and fix the mistake in the following PHP code:
        code: |
          <?php
              $a = 10;
              $b = 0;
              echo $a / $b;
          ?>
        hint: Division by zero will result in an error.
        issue: The code attempts to divide by zero, which will cause a warning in PHP.
        solution: |
          <?php
              $a = 10;
              $b = 2;  // Changed $b to a non-zero value
              echo $a / $b;
          ?>

          Identify and fix the mistake in the following PHP code:
        code: |
          <?php
              $num = 10;
              if ($num = 5) {
                  echo "The number is 5";
              } else {
                  echo "The number is not 5";
              }
          ?>
        hint: Be cautious with the assignment operator (`=`) inside conditionals.
        issue: The `=` operator is used for assignment, not comparison. The correct operator is `==`.
        solution: |
          <?php
              $num = 10;
              if ($num == 5) {  // Changed = to ==
                  echo "The number is 5";
              } else {
                  echo "The number is not 5";
              }
          ?>

        prompt: |
          Identify and fix the mistake in the following PHP code:
        code: |
          <?php
              $text = "Hello World";
              echo "The text is: $Text";  // Notice the case of the variable name
          ?>
        hint: Variable names in PHP are case-sensitive.
        issue: The variable `$Text` is not defined. It should be `$text` (case-sensitive).
        solution: |
          <?php
              $text = "Hello World";
              echo "The text is: $text";  // Corrected variable name
          ?>

        prompt: |
          Identify and fix the mistake in the following PHP code:
        code: |
          <?php
              $arr = array(1, 2, 3);
              echo $arr[3];
          ?>
        hint: Array indices start at 0, so the valid indices are 0, 1, and 2 for this array.
        issue: The index `3` is out of bounds for the array.
        solution: |
          <?php
              $arr = array(1, 2, 3);
              echo $arr[2];  // Corrected to a valid index
          ?>
