## Module 1: Bits

A bit is the smallest unit of information in a computer. It can be either 0 or 1. Bits are used to represent all of the data that is stored and processed on a computer, including text, images, audio, and video.

Module 12: Boolean Operations

Boolean operations are used to manipulate bits. The two most common Boolean operations are AND and OR. The AND operation returns 1 if both bits are 1, and 0 otherwise. The OR operation returns 1 if either bit is 1, and 0 otherwise.

Module 13: Hexadecimal Notation

Hexadecimal notation is a way of representing numbers using 16 symbols instead of 10. The hexadecimal symbols are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, and F.

Module 14: Storing a Bit

Bits are stored in memory using electrical charges. A bit is stored as a high voltage if it is a 1, and a low voltage if it is a 0.

### What is a bit?

- A bit is the smallest unit of information in a computer. 
- It can be either 0 or 1. 
- Bits are used to represent all of the data that is stored and processed on a computer, including text, images, audio, and video.

### How are bits represented?

- Bits can be represented in a variety of ways, including electronically, optically, and magnetically.
- In most computers, bits are represented electronically using transistors.
- A transistor is a semiconductor device that can be switched to either a conducting or non-conducting state. When a transistor is conducting, it represents a 1 bit. When a transistor is non-conducting, it represents a 0 bit.

### How are bits used?

Bits are used in a variety of ways in computers. For example, bits are used to:

**Represent text characters:** Each character in the English alphabet is represented by a unique sequence of bits.
**Represent images:** Images are represented by a grid of pixels. Each pixel is represented by a combination of red, green, and blue bits.
**Represent audio:** Audio is represented by a series of samples. Each sample is represented by a combination of bits.
**Represent video:** Video is represented by a series of images. Each image is represented by a grid of pixels. Each pixel is represented by a combination of red, green, and blue bits.
Examples of bits in use

Here are some examples of how bits are used in the real world:

- When you type a letter on your keyboard, the computer converts the letter to a sequence of bits. These bits are then sent to the monitor, which displays the letter on the screen.
- When you take a photo with your digital camera, the camera converts the image to a grid of pixels. Each pixel is represented by a combination of red, green, and blue bits. These bits are then stored on the camera's memory card.
- When you listen to a song on your MP3 player, the player converts the song to a series of samples. Each sample is represented by a combination of bits. These bits are then played through the player's speakers.
- When you watch a video on your computer, the computer converts the video to a series of images. Each image is represented by a grid of pixels. Each pixel is represented by a combination of red, green, and blue bits. These bits are then displayed on the computer's monitor.

## Units of measurement for storage data

| Sr. No. | Units | Abbr. | Description | Approximate Size |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---|
| 1       | Bit |  | Computer works with binary digits in 0’s and 1’s form. A binary digit is called bit. |  |
| 2       | Nibble |  | 4 bit |  |
| 3       | Byte |  | 8 bit  (Store single character) | 1 character |
| 4       | Kilobyte | KB | 1024 Bytes | 1 page |
| 5       | Megabyte | MB | 1024 KB (1 millon bytes) | 1000 pages |
| 6       | Gigabyte | GB | 1024 MB(1 billion bytes) | 1 million pages |
| 7       | Terabyte | TB | 1024 GB(1 trillion bytes) | 1 billion pages |

## Patterns Using Bits

A bit pattern is a sequence of bits, which are the smallest unit of data in computing.A bit can have two values: 0 or 1. Bit patterns are used to represent all kinds of data, including numbers, letters, symbols, and images.

Bit patterns can be of any length, but they are typically represented as strings of binary digits. For example, the bit pattern "01001101" represents the letter "A" in ASCII code. [^1]

Bit patterns are used in a wide variety of computing applications. For example, they are used to store and transmit data, to encode and decode information, and to perform mathematical and logical operations.

Here are some examples of bit patterns:

- The bit pattern "00110001" represents the number 1 in ASCII code.
- The bit pattern "01001000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111" represents the word "Hello" in ASCII code.

Bit patterns are a powerful tool for representing and manipulating information in computing.
