## Basics

- A bit can have two values: 0 or 1.
- The binary number system is a base-2 number system that uses only two digits: 0 and 1. The binary number system is used to represent bits.

### What Bits can represent

- Representing numbers, text, audio, video, image etc.
- In Chip electric Charge 0/1

## Units of measurement for storage data

| Sr. No. | Units | Abbr. | Description | Approximate Size |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---|
| 1       | Bit |  | Computer works with binary digits in 0’s and 1’s form. A binary digit is called bit. |  |
| 2       | Nibble |  | 4 bit |  |
| 3       | Byte |  | 8 bit  (Store single character) | 1 character |
| 4       | Kilobyte | KB | 1024 Bytes | 1 page |
| 5       | Megabyte | MB | 1024 KB (1 millon bytes) | 1000 pages |
| 6       | Gigabyte | GB | 1024 MB(1 billion bytes) | 1 million pages |
| 7       | Terabyte | TB | 1024 GB(1 trillion bytes) | 1 billion pages |

## Patterns Using Bits

A bit pattern is a sequence of bits, which are the smallest unit of data in computing.A bit can have two values: 0 or 1. Bit patterns are used to represent all kinds of data, including numbers, letters, symbols, and images.

Bit patterns can be of any length, but they are typically represented as strings of binary digits. For example, the bit pattern "01001101" represents the letter "A" in ASCII code. [^1]

Bit patterns are used in a wide variety of computing applications. For example, they are used to store and transmit data, to encode and decode information, and to perform mathematical and logical operations.

Here are some examples of bit patterns:

- The bit pattern "00110001" represents the number 1 in ASCII code.
- The bit pattern "01001000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111" represents the word "Hello" in ASCII code.

Bit patterns are a powerful tool for representing and manipulating information in computing.
