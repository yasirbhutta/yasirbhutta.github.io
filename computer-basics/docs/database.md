## Database Basics

**What is a database?**
    * A database is an organized collection of data, or information, that is stored electronically on a computer system.
    * Databases are used to store a wide variety of data, such as customer information, product information, financial data, and scientific data.

**Why use a database?**
    * Databases offer a number of advantages over traditional methods of data storage, such as paper files and spreadsheets.
    * Databases are `more efficient` to store and manage large amounts of data.
    * Databases allow for `easy searching and retrieval of data`.
    * Databases can be used to `share data` with other users.

**Types of databases:**
    * There are many different types of databases, but the most common are `relational databases` and `non-relational databases`.
    * **Relational databases** store data in tables, where each table is made up of rows and columns.
    * **Non-relational databases** store data in a variety of formats, such as XML or JSON.

## Database Design

* Database design is the process of creating a database that is efficient and meets the needs of the users.
* There are a number of steps involved in database design, such as:
    * Identifying the data that needs to be stored
    * Determining the relationships between the data
    * Normalizing the data
    * Creating a database schema

## Database Management Systems (DBMS)

* A database management system (DBMS) is a software program that is used to create, manage, and access databases.
* Some popular DBMSs include Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft SQL Server.

## SQL

* SQL is a structured query language that is used to communicate with databases.
* SQL can be used to create, read, update, and delete data in a database.
