## Database Basics

**What is a database?**

- A database is an organized collection of data, or information, that is stored electronically on a computer system.
- Databases are used to store a wide variety of data, such as customer information, product information, financial data, and scientific data.

**Why use a database?**

- Databases offer a number of advantages over traditional methods of data storage, such as paper files and spreadsheets.
- Databases are `more efficient` to store and manage large amounts of data.
- Databases allow for `easy searching and retrieval of data`.
- Databases can be used to `share data` with other users.

**Types of databases:**

- There are many different types of databases, but the most common are `relational databases` and `non-relational databases`.
    * **Relational databases** store data in tables, where each table is made up of rows and columns.
    * **Non-relational databases** store data in a variety of formats, such as XML or JSON.

## Database Design

- Database design is the process of creating a database that is efficient and meets the needs of the users.
- There are a number of steps involved in database design, such as:
  - Identifying the data that needs to be stored
  - Determining the relationships between the data
  - Normalizing the data
  - Creating a database schema

## Database Management Systems (DBMS)

- A database management system (DBMS) is a software program that is used to `create`, `manage`, and `access databases`.
- Some popular DBMSs include `Oracle`, `MySQL`, and `Microsoft SQL Server`.

## SQL

- SQL is a structured query language that is used to `communicate with databases`.
- SQL can be used to create, read, update, and delete data in a database.

## Microsoft Access

**Microsoft Access** is a **database management system (DBMS)** developed by Microsoft. It combines the **relational Access Database Engine (ACE)** with a **graphical user interface (GUI)** and software-development tools. Here's what you can do with Microsoft Access:

1. **Create Databases**: You can build databases quickly using templates, even if you're not a developer.
2. **Data Management**: Easily find, report on, and manipulate data stored in Access.
3. **Forms**: Create rich data entry forms.
4. **Data Import/Export**: Import, transform, and export data from various sources¹².
