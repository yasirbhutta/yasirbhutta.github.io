## Types of networks

**Local Area Networks (LANs):** These connect devices in a limited area, like a home, school, or office. Imagine all the computers in a computer lab connected to a single printer – that's a LAN!

**Wide Area Networks (WANs):** These connect LANs across geographically dispersed locations, often using the internet as the backbone. Think of connecting all the branches of a bank across different cities – that's a WAN!

**Wireless Networks:** These networks connect devices without using cables, relying on Wi-Fi or other wireless technologies. Imagine connecting your laptop to the internet without wires – that's a wireless network!

## Network components

**Routers:** These direct traffic between networks

**Switches:** These connect devices within a LAN

**Modems:** These translate data between digital and analog formats

## Basic network protocols

- the set of rules that governs how data is transmitted across networks.

**TCP/IP:** This suite of protocols defines how data is formatted, addressed, transmitted, and received across networks. It's like the set of rules that everyone on the network follows to communicate effectively.

## The internet: How it works and how to access it

### Internet

- The internet is a global network of interconnected computers, servers, phones, and other devices.
