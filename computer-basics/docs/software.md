## Types of Software

### 1. System Software

- System software is an program that controls the computer's hardware or that can be used to maintain the computer in some way so that it runs more efficiently.
- System software is a generic term referring to any computer software whose purpose is to help run the computer system
- Most of it is responsible directly for controlling, integrating, and managing the individual hardware components of a computer system.

Some examples of system software are:

1.1 **Operating system:** 

- The operating system is a software that controls and coordinates the computer hardware devices and runs other software and applications on a computer 
- It provides a foundation for applications to run and offers essential services, such as managing memory, processing tasks, handling input and output, and managing files and data. 
- It serves as the interface between hardware, application software, and the user.

Some common examples of operating systems are:

  1. **Windows (98,2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10,11)** – Used in personal computers and enterprise environments.
  2. **macOS** – The primary operating system for Apple’s Mac computers.
  3. **Linux (Ubuntu)** – An open-source operating system commonly used for servers, personal computers, and embedded systems.
  4. **Android** – Used in smartphones, tablets, and some other mobile devices.

1.2 **Device Drivers:** 

- The communication between the operating system and hardware components is facilitated by device drivers.
(Sound Card, Monitor, VGA, Modem, CR-Rom Drive Etc)

1.3 **Utility Program:**

- A utility is a program that makes the computer system easier to use or performs highly specialized functions.
- Utilities are used to manage disks, troubleshoot hardware problems, and perform other tasks that the operating system itself may not be able to do.

**Examples:** File Compressor, Disk Scanner, Antivirus, Backup Utility, Disk Cleanup

## Open Source Software vs Proprietary Software

### Open Source Software (OSS)

- **Open Code:** The source code is publicly available for anyone to see, modify, and redistribute.
- **Collaborative Development:** Anyone can contribute to the software's development by fixing bugs, adding features, and improving functionality.
- **Cost-Effective:** Often free or significantly cheaper than proprietary software, reducing costs for individuals and organizations.
- **Transparency:** Openness of code builds trust and allows users to verify what the software does.
- **Security:** Large community involvement can lead to faster bug fixes and improved security.

**Examples:** Linux operating system, Firefox web browser, LibreOffice productivity suite, WordPress content management system.

### Proprietary Software

- **Closed Code:** The source code is kept secret, only accessible to the software's developer or owner.
- **Controlled Development:** Development is limited to the software company's employees or contracted developers.
- **Costly:** Usually licenses require purchase or subscription fees, potentially leading to higher overall costs.
- **Black Box:** Users trust the software to work as advertised without knowing how it does so.
- **Security:** May be slower to fix bugs as updates rely solely on the developer.

**Examples:** Microsoft Windows operating system, Adobe Photoshop editing software, Microsoft Office productivity suite, QuickBooks accounting software.
