## What is Software

- Software is the set of programs( instructions) that tell a computer what to do.

**Software Silent Features:**

- A computer works according to the given instructions in the software.
- Software is logical part of a computer and cannot be touched.
- The hardware cannot perform any task without software. 
- It is copied from the disk into the main memory of the computer as and when required.

Command, Programs,Software

## Types of Software

### 1. System Software

- System software is an program that controls the computer's hardware or that can be used to maintain the computer in some way so that it runs more efficiently.
- System software is a generic term referring to any computer software whose purpose is to help run the computer system
- Most of it is responsible directly for controlling, integrating, and managing the individual hardware components of a computer system.

Some examples of system software are:

**Operating system:** 

- The operating system is a software that controls and coordinates the computer hardware devices and runs other software and applications on a computer - It serves as the interface between hardware, application software, and the user.

Examples: 
Windows (98,2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10,11),Linux (Ubuntu), Macintosh

**Device Drivers:** 

- The communication between the operating system and hardware components is facilitated by device drivers.
(Sound Card, Monitor, VGA, Modem, CR-Rom Drive Etc)
- **Utility program** (File Compressor, Disk Scanner, Antivirus, Backup Utility, Disk Cleanup)

**Utility Program:**

- A utility is a program that makes the computer system easier to use or performs highly specialized functions.
- Utilities are used to manage disks, troubleshoot hardware problems, and perform other tasks that the operating system itself may not be able to do.
  
### 2. Application Software

- The software, which has been developed to perform specific task is called application software. 
  
**Example:**

- [Microsoft 365](https://www.microsoft365.com/): Used for documentation, prepare spread sheets and presentation etc.
- [Corel Draw](https://www.coreldraw.com/en/): Corel Draw is an commercial software that used for picture drawing, editing and also used for publication.
Corel Draw.
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_pk/chrome/): Used for web page browsing
- [Microsoft Team](https://teams.microsoft.com/): Used for Video, Audio and Text based chat. Other popular chatting software's are Microsoft Team, Google Meet, WhatsApp, [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) etc
  - [Microsoft Team Demo](https://teamsdemo.office.com/)
- Adobe Reader: Used to view adobe PDF files.
- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/): This free and open-source image manipulation software is a powerful alternative to Photoshop, making it a popular choice for hobbyists and professionals alike.
- [CapCut](https://www.capcut.com/): Free all-in-one video editor for everyone to create anything anywhere
- [VLC Media Player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/): This free and open-source media player can play virtually any audio or video format, making it a popular choice for users worldwide.

## Open Source Software vs Proprietary Software

### Open Source Software (OSS)

**Open Code:** The source code is publicly available for anyone to see, modify, and redistribute.
**Collaborative Development:** Anyone can contribute to the software's development by fixing bugs, adding features, and improving functionality.
**Cost-Effective:** Often free or significantly cheaper than proprietary software, reducing costs for individuals and organizations.
**Transparency:** Openness of code builds trust and allows users to verify what the software does.
**Security:** Large community involvement can lead to faster bug fixes and improved security.
**Examples:** Linux operating system, Firefox web browser, LibreOffice productivity suite, WordPress content management system.

### Proprietary Software

**Closed Code:** The source code is kept secret, only accessible to the software's developer or owner.
**Controlled Development:** Development is limited to the software company's employees or contracted developers.
**Costly:** Usually licenses require purchase or subscription fees, potentially leading to higher overall costs.
**Black Box:** Users trust the software to work as advertised without knowing how it does so.
**Security:** May be slower to fix bugs as updates rely solely on the developer.
**Examples:** Microsoft Windows operating system, Adobe Photoshop editing software, Microsoft Office productivity suite, QuickBooks accounting software.
