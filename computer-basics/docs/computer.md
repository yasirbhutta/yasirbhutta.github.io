### What is a Computer?

> A computer is a programmable device for processing, storing, and displaying information. [1]

or

> An electronic machine that can store, organize and find information, do processes with numbers and other data, and control other machines [Oxford Dictionary](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/computer)

### Areas of Application

Computers are used in almost every field of human activity today. Some of the most common areas of application of computers include:

- **Education:** Computers are used in schools and universities to teach a wide range of subjects, from math and science to computer programming and art. Computers are also used to provide students with access to educational resources from around the world.
- **Business:** Computers are used in businesses of all sizes to manage inventory, track sales, communicate with customers, and process payments. Computers are also used to develop and market new products and services.
- **Government:** Computers are used by government agencies to provide services to citizens, manage public finances, and enforce laws.
- **Healthcare:** Computers are used in hospitals and clinics to diagnose diseases, track patient records, and perform surgery. Computers are also used to develop new drugs and medical treatments.
- **Science and engineering:** Computers are used by scientists and engineers to design experiments, analyze data, and develop new products and technologies.
- **Entertainment:** Computers are used to create and distribute movies, music, video games, and other forms of entertainment.

### Data and Information

Computer process data (input) into information (output) and often store the data and resulting information for further use.

#### What is a Data?

- Data is a collection of unprocessed items, which can be include text, numbers, images, audio and video.

**Characteristics of Data:**

- Data is raw, that is not very meaningful
- Requires processing to be done on them to suit requirements.
- Gets converted into information after processing.

#### What is a Process?

- The computation done on the data to generate result is called Process. It could be any arithmetic  or logical operation done on the data.

**Examples:**

- addition
- subtraction
- multiplication
- comparisons using operators like <,>,=

#### What is Information?

- Information is defined as classified or organized data that has some `meaningful` value for the user.
- Information is also the `processed data` used to make decisions and take action. [3]
  
### How The Computer Process?

- The Computer needs processing instructions to be given to it for performing the computations.

**Command:** The instruction given is known as a Command.

**Program:** A set of instructions that tells a computer what to do.

| Feature    | Command                                  | Program                                                |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Definition | A single instruction given to a computer | A set of instructions that tells a computer what to do |
| Execution  | Executed immediately                     | Can be executed later                                  |
| Purpose    | Performs a specific task                 | Can perform a variety of tasks                         |

Here are some examples of commands and programs:

**Commands:**

- ls (list directory contents)
- mkdir (create directory)
- rm (remove file or directory)
- ping (test network connectivity)
- shutdown (shut down computer)

**Programs:**

- Microsoft Word (word processor)
- Google Chrome (web browser)
- Adobe Photoshop (image editing software)
- VLC Media Player (video player)
- Minecraft (video game)
