**Types of computer hardware:**

- **Internal hardware:** Internal hardware is the hardware that is located inside the computer case. It includes the following components:
  - **Motherboard:** The motherboard is the main circuit board of a computer. It connects all of the other internal components together.
  - **CPU:** The CPU is the brain of the computer. It is responsible for processing instructions and performing calculations.
  - **Memory:** Memory is used to store data and programs that the CPU is currently using. There are two main types of memory: random access memory (RAM) and read-only memory (ROM).
  - **Storage devices:** Storage devices are used to store data permanently. Common storage devices include hard disk drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs), and optical drives (such as CD-ROM and DVD drives).
  - Expansion cards: Expansion cards are used to add new features to a computer, such as a graphics card, sound card, or network card.
- **External hardware:** External hardware is the hardware that is connected to the computer but is located outside of the computer case. It includes the following devices:
  - **Input devices:** Input devices are used to enter data into the computer. Common input devices include keyboards, mice, trackpads, touchscreens, and scanners.
  - **Output devices:** Output devices are used to display or print data from the computer. Common output devices include monitors, printers, and speakers.
  - **Networking hardware:** Networking hardware is used to connect a computer to a network. Common networking devices include routers, switches, and modems.
  
Other types of computer hardware include:

- Power supply unit (PSU): The PSU provides power to all of the other components in the computer.
- Cooling system: The cooling system keeps the computer from overheating.
- Case/System Unit: The case houses all of the internal components of the computer and protects them from damage.
