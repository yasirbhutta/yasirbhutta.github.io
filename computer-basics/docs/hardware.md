### Output Devices

- The hardware components that are used to receive information from the computer are called output devices.
- Output devices take information from the computer and convert it in a form that is understandable by the users.

#### Hard Copy & Soft Copy

**Hard Copy:** material printed by a computer on paper.

**Soft Copy:** technical information stored in a computer’s memory or shown on a screen rather than printed on paper.

#### 1. Monitor

A computer monitor is an essential output device for a computer. It visually displays the information processed by the computer, allowing you to see text, images, videos, and graphics.  

- **Displays Information:** Monitors translate the electronic signals from the computer's graphics card into a visual format on the screen.
- **Types of Monitors:** Modern monitors are typically flat-panel displays, using technologies like LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) with LED backlight. Older monitors used CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) technology.
- **Connection to Computer:** Monitors connect to the computer through various ports like HDMI, DisplayPort, DVI, or VGA.
- **Resolution:** Monitors come in various sizes and resolutions, which determine the sharpness and detail of the displayed image.

There are several types of computer monitors:

1.1 **LCD (liquid crystal display) monitors**

- LCD monitors are the most common type of monitor available today.
- They are thin, lightweight, and energy-efficient.
- LCD monitors use liquid crystals to create images on the screen.

1.2 **LED (light-emitting diode) monitors**

- LED monitors are a type of LCD monitor that uses light-emitting diodes (LEDs) as the backlight instead of fluorescent lamps.
- LEDs are more energy-efficient and have a longer lifespan than fluorescent lamps.
- LED monitors also tend to have `better image quality than LCD monitors`, with higher `contrast ratios` and `brighter colors`.

The contrast ratio (CR) is a property of a display system, defined as the ratio of the luminance of the brightest shade (white) to that of the darkest shade (black) that the system is capable of producing. A high contrast ratio is a desired aspect of any display. [^3]

1.3 **CRT (cathode ray tube) monitors**

- CRT monitors are the oldest type of computer monitor.
- They are bulky and heavy, and they consume a lot of power.

### CPU or Processor

- CPU stands for `Central Processing Unit`.
- It is the brain of the computer.
- It is also called processor.
- CPU continually receives instructions to execute. CPU performs all operations according to the given instructions. It executes instructions and tells other parts of computer what to do.
  
CPU consists of two main units:

- **ALU (Arithmetic and logic Unit)**
- **CU (Control Unit)**

#### ALU (Arithmetic and Logic Unit)

- ALU is a part of CPU. Actual  execution of the instructions takes place in this part.

It Consists two units:

- **Arithmetic Unit :** Arithmetic unit of the ALU `performs basic arithmetic functions` such as additions, subtraction, multiplications and division.
- **Logic Unit :** Logic unit of the ALU `performs logical operations` like comparing two data items to find which data item is greater than ,equal to or less than the other.

#### Control Unit

- It controls all activities of computer system.
- It is also called the `supervisor` of the computer.

The CPU (Central Processing Unit) performs a variety of operations, typically classified into several types:

1. Arithmetic Operations: These include basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) handles these tasks.
2. Logical Operations: The CPU performs logical operations like AND, OR, NOT, and XOR, used in decision-making processes.
3. Data Transfer Operations: The CPU moves data from one location to another, such as from memory to registers, registers to memory, or between different registers.
4. Control Operations: These involve decision-making instructions, such as comparing values and jumping to different instructions based on conditions (e.g., branch instructions).
5. Input/Output Operations: The CPU manages communication with external devices, reading input from devices like a keyboard or writing output to devices like a monitor or printer.

**Machine Cycles**

- Each time the CPU executes an instructions, It takes a series of steps. The complete series of steps is called machine cycle. 
- A machine cycle itself can be broken down into two smaller cycles: the instruction cycle and the execution cycle.

**1. Instruction cycle**

1. **Fetching**: The CPU retrieves an instruction from the computer's memory (RAM).
2. **Decoding**: The CPU interprets (decodes) the fetched instruction to understand what needs to be done (breaks the command into instuction set the CPU can handle)

**2. Execution cycle**

3. **Executing**: The CPU performs the operation specified by the instruction (e.g., arithmetic operations like addition, multiplication, etc.).
4. **Storing**: The CPU stores the result of the operation back into memory, registers, or sends it to an output device. For more details, see [1, p. 130].

The performance of your CPU significantly impacts how fast your computer can run programs and perform tasks. Here are some key factors that affect CPU performance:

- **Clock speed:** Measured in Gigahertz (GHz), it indicates the number of cycles the CPU can perform per second. Higher clock speeds generally mean faster performance.
- **Number of cores:** Modern CPUs typically have multiple cores, allowing them to handle multiple tasks simultaneously. More cores can improve performance for multitasking and programs that can leverage multiple cores.
- **Cache:** A small amount of high-speed memory built into the CPU that stores frequently accessed data and instructions. Faster access to this data can improve processing speed. for more details, see [Appendix A](#appendix-a-cpu-clock-speed-and-cycles)

### Motherboard

- The motherboard is `main circuit board` of a computer, usually containing the central processing unit and main system memory as well as circuitry that controls the disk drives, keyboard, monitor, and other peripheral devices.
- It is also known as a mainboard, baseboard, system board.

**Motherboard's key functions:**

- **Connectivity:** It provides sockets and slots for essential components like the CPU, RAM (memory), graphics card, storage drives (hard drive or SSD), and other peripherals.
- **Communication:** The motherboard has electrical pathways (buses) that enable all these components to transfer data and instructions between each other.
- **Control Center:** It houses the chipset, a group of specialized chips that manage communication between different parts and control functions like USB ports, audio, and network connectivity.
- **Power Delivery:** The motherboard distributes power from the power supply unit (PSU) to all the connected components.

- single core vs multi-core CPU

**Answer:**

A single-core CPU has only one processing unit, while a multi-core CPU has multiple processing units. In other words, a single-core CPU can only execute one instruction at a time, while a multi-core CPU can execute multiple instructions simultaneously.

- What is the clock speed of a CPU?

**Answer:**

The clock speed of a processor refers to the number of cycles it can execute per second, essentially acting like its heartbeat. It's measured in hertz (Hz), with common units being:

**MHz (megahertz):** Millions of cycles per second. Used for older processors.
**GHz (gigahertz):** Billions of cycles per second. Standard for modern processors, ranging from around 2 GHz to 4 GHz or even higher.

- What is the difference between a 32-bit and a 64-bit CPU?

**Answer:**

Data Handling:

- 32-bit CPU: Can process 32 bits of data at a time, which equals 4 bytes. 
- 64-bit CPU: Can process 64 bits of data at a time, which equals 8 bytes. This allows them to handle much larger numbers and complex calculations more efficiently.

Memory Access:

- 32-bit CPU: Can address a maximum of 4GB of RAM (random access memory). This means they can only use up to 4GB of RAM at a time.
- 64-bit CPU: Can address a vast amount of RAM, theoretically up to 18 quintillion gigabytes. In practice, the actual limit depends on the specific CPU and operating system, but it's significantly higher than 32-bit CPUs.

### **Appendix A: CPU Clock Speed and Cycles**

The term **GHz (Gigahertz)** in CPU specifications refers to the processor's clock speed, indicating how many cycles it can complete per second. Specifically, **1 GHz equals 1 billion cycles per second**. [6]

A **clock cycle**, or simply a "cycle," is the fundamental unit of time for a CPU's operations. During each cycle, the CPU can perform basic tasks such as fetching an instruction, accessing memory, or writing data. However, most CPU processes require multiple clock cycles to complete complex instructions. [7]

While a higher clock speed generally means the CPU can process more cycles per second, overall performance also depends on other factors, such as the number of instructions the CPU can execute per cycle (known as Instructions Per Cycle or IPC), the number of cores, and the processor's architecture.
