#### Work with email drafts on Google Docs

2. At the top left, click `Insert` and then  `Building blocks` and then  `Email draft`.
    - You can also type "@email" in the doc and press Enter.
3. To add recipients in the "To" field, type "@" and search your contacts, or type out email addresses.
4. You can add a subject line, write text in the email body, and format your draft.

#### Preview and send your email draft in Gmail

1. At the top left of the email draft, click `Preview in Gmail`.
2. In the pop-up Gmail window, you can make additional changes to your email.
3. When you are ready, click `Send`.
    - **Important:** The email draft will be sent from the account you are logged into.

#### Use the @ menu

1. On your computer, open a document in Google Docs.
2. Type "@".
3. Select from the list of suggestions.

- **Tip:** To narrow your suggestions, you can type letters, numbers, or symbols after the "@". For example, to insert an email draft into your doc, type `@email` and press Enter.
