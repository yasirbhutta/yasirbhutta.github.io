### What is Search Engine

A search engine is a software system designed to help users find information on the internet. When you enter a query into a search engine, it searches its database for relevant web pages and presents a list of results. These results typically include hyperlinks to web pages, along with brief descriptions or summaries.

Search engines work by using automated programs called web crawlers or spiders to scan and index the content of web pages. This indexed information is then used to quickly retrieve relevant results when a user performs a search.[1][2]

### How to Search on Google

[https://www.google.com/](https://www.google.com/)

- **Tip 1: Start with the basics**

- No matter what you're looking for, start with a simple search like **where's the closest airport?**. You can always add a few descriptive words if necessary.
- If you're looking for a place or product in a specific location, add the location.For example, **Multan**.

- Tip 2: Search using your voice

- To search with your voice, say **"Ok Google"** or **select the Microphone**

- **Tip 3: Choose words carefully**

- When you're deciding what words to put in the search box, try to choose words that are likely to appear on the site you're looking for.
- **For example,** instead of saying **my head hurts**, say **headache**, because that’s the word a medical site would use.

- **Tip 4: Don’t worry about the little things**

- Spelling: Google's spell checker automatically uses the most common spelling of a given word, whether or not you spell it correctly.
- **Capitalization:** A search for New York Times is the same as a search for new york times.

- **Tip 5: Find quick answers**

Search for the name of a celebrity, location, movie, or song to find related information. 

For example:

```google
population pakistan
```

```google
unemployment rate pakistan
```

```google
unemployment rate china
```

### Flip a coin

- To flip a coin in Google Search, simply type "flip a coin" in the search bar and click on the "Search" button. Google will then display a coin flipping animation, and the result will be either "Heads" or "Tails".
- You can also flip a coin in Google Search using the following voice command: "Hey Google, flip a coin."
- If you want to flip a coin more than once, you can simply click on the "Flip again" button.

### “I’m feeling lucky”

- click on "I'm feeling lucky" if you're searching for the site of a company or the official site of a product.
- "I'm feeling lucky" sends you to the first search result.

## Module 2

```

<script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-1602443888929206"
     crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

     data-ad-client="ca-pub-1602443888929206"
     data-ad-slot="6296238623"></ins>
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>

### Advanced Search Operators

```

#### Inurl

     data-ad-client="ca-pub-1602443888929206"
     data-ad-slot="6296238623"></ins>
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>

### Search Operators
