## How to Search on Google

[https://www.google.com/](https://www.google.com/)

### Tip 1: Start with the basics

- No matter what you're looking for, start with a simple search like **where's the closest airport?**. You can always add a few descriptive words if necessary.
- If you're looking for a place or product in a specific location, add the location.For example, **Multan**.

### Tip 2: Search using your voice

- To search with your voice, say **"Ok Google"** or **select the Microphone**

### Tip 3: Choose words carefully

- When you're deciding what words to put in the search box, try to choose words that are likely to appear on the site you're looking for.
- **For example,** instead of saying **my head hurts**, say **headache**, because that’s the word a medical site would use.

### Tip 4: Don’t worry about the little things

- Spelling: Google's spell checker automatically uses the most common spelling of a given word, whether or not you spell it correctly.
- **Capitalization:** A search for New York Times is the same as a search for new york times.

### Tip 5: Find quick answers

### weather

For example,

```google
weather Multan 
```

or

```google
weather Lahore
```

## define

Google Search Keywords - define

Put define in front of any word to see its definition.

For example,

```google
define gorgeous
```

```google
define character
```

### Calculations

Enter a math equation like **3*9123**, or solve complex graphing equations.

### Unit conversions

Enter any conversion, like **3 dollars in euros**.

- To convert from meter to inches: **10.5 meter to inches**
- To convert litre to ml: **10.6 liter in ml**
- To convert cm to inches: **10 cm to inches**
- To convert Fahrenheit to Centigrade: **100 f to c**
- To convert number in Roman: **125 to roman**

### Quick facts

Search for the name of a celebrity, location, movie, or song to find related information. 

For example:

```google
population pakistan
```

```google
unemployment rate pakistan
```

```google
unemployment rate china
```

### image

Google finds images just as easily and lists them at the top, when you add image to the end of your search.

For example,

```google
flower image
```

### Expert search tips

#### Search Operators

- You can use symbols or words in your search to make your search results more precise.
Google Search usually ignores punctuation that isn’t part of a search operator.
- Don’t put spaces between the symbol or word and your search term. A search for site:nytimes.com will work, but site: nytimes.com won’t.

#### Refine image searches

Overall Advanced Search
Go to Advanced Image Search.
Use filters like region or file type to narrow your results.
At the bottom, click Advanced Search.

#### Search for an exact image size

Right after the word you're looking for, add the text imagesize:widthxheight. Make sure to add the dimensions in pixels.

- Example: **imagesize:500x400**

```
