## Module 1

### How to Search on Google

[https://www.google.com/](https://www.google.com/)

#### Tip 1: Start with the basics

- No matter what you're looking for, start with a simple search like **where's the closest airport?**. You can always add a few descriptive words if necessary.
- If you're looking for a place or product in a specific location, add the location.For example, **Multan**.

#### Tip 2: Search using your voice

- To search with your voice, say **"Ok Google"** or **select the Microphone**

#### Tip 3: Choose words carefully

- When you're deciding what words to put in the search box, try to choose words that are likely to appear on the site you're looking for.
- **For example,** instead of saying **my head hurts**, say **headache**, because that’s the word a medical site would use.

#### Tip 4: Don’t worry about the little things

- Spelling: Google's spell checker automatically uses the most common spelling of a given word, whether or not you spell it correctly.
- **Capitalization:** A search for New York Times is the same as a search for new york times.

#### Tip 5: Find quick answers

Search for the name of a celebrity, location, movie, or song to find related information. 

For example:

```google
population pakistan
```

```google
unemployment rate pakistan
```

```google
unemployment rate china
```

### Flip a coin

- To flip a coin in Google Search, simply type "flip a coin" in the search bar and click on the "Search" button. Google will then display a coin flipping animation, and the result will be either "Heads" or "Tails".
- You can also flip a coin in Google Search using the following voice command: "Hey Google, flip a coin."
- If you want to flip a coin more than once, you can simply click on the "Flip again" button.

### “I’m feeling lucky”

- click on "I'm feeling lucky" if you're searching for the site of a company or the official site of a product.
- "I'm feeling lucky" sends you to the first search result.

### Module 2

### Weather Searching

For example,

```google
weather Multan 
```

or

```google
weather Lahore
```

### Calculations

Enter a math equation like **3*9123**, or solve complex graphing equations.

### Unit conversions

Enter any conversion, like **3 dollars in euros**.

- To convert from meter to inches: **10.5 meter to inches**
- To convert litre to ml: **10.6 liter in ml**
- To convert cm to inches: **10 cm to inches**
- To convert Fahrenheit to Centigrade: **100 f to c**
- To convert number in Roman: **125 to roman**

## Module 3

### Search social media

Put @ in front of a word to search social media.

For example:

```google
@twitter
```

```google
islam @twitter
```

```google
islam @facebook
```

### Search for a price

Put $ in front of a number.

For example:

```google
camera $400
```

### Search hashtags

Put # in front of a word.
For example:

```google
#islam
```

### Exclude words from your search

Put - in front of a word you want to leave out.

examples,

```google
jaguar speed -car
```

or

```google
electric cars -Tesla
```

or

```google
best smartphones -Apple -Samsung
```

### Search for an exact match

Put a word or phrase inside quotes.

For example,
  
```google
"tallest building"
```

**Wild Card based Searching:**

```google
"tallest * building"
```

## Module 4

### Search within a range of numbers

Put .. between two numbers.

- For example,

```google
camera $50..$100.
```

#### Combine searches

- Put **"OR"** between each search query.
- For example,
  
```google
marathon OR race
```

### Search for a specific site

- Put "site:" in front of a site or domain.

For example,

```google
site:youtube.com
```

```google
site:.gov
```

### Search for related sites

- To search for web pages that have similar content to a given site,Put "related:" in front of a web address you already know.

- For example,

```google
related:cnn.com
```

or

```google
related:freepik.com
```

or

```google
related:facebook.com
```

- The Google search `info` keyword is a special keyword that allows you to get information about a particular website. To use it, simply type info: followed by the website's URL into the Google search bar.

For example, to get information about the website wikipedia.org, you would type `info:wikipedia.org` into the search bar. Google would then return a page with information about the website, such as its title, description, page load speed, and other metrics.

### See Google’s cached version of a site

- Put **"cache:"** in front of the site address.

### Search by file type

- You can use the filetype: operator in Google Search to limit results to a specific file type or file extension.
- For example, **filetype:pptx computer** will search for PPTX files and URLs ending in .pptx whose content contains the term "computer".

```google
filetype:pdf climate change report
```

```google
filetype:xlsx financial statements
```

```google
filetype:docx how to write a resume
```

#### Search for an exact image size

Right after the word you're looking for, add the text imagesize:widthxheight. Make sure to add the dimensions in pixels.

- Example:

```google
imagesize:500x400**
```

### Advanced Search Operators

#### intitle

- Google has some very powerful, hidden search parameters, too. For example "intitle" only searches page titles.
  
For example,

```googe
intitle:herbs
```

```google
filetype:pptx intitle:social media marketing
```

#### Inurl

The modifier inurl only searches the web address of a page: give 

```google
inurl:herbs
```

#### intext

If we are interested to search anywhere in the body of the document, we can use intext operator, for example:

```google
intext: "Ghazi University admissions 2023”
```

### Search Operators

- You can use symbols or words in your search to make your search results more precise.
Google Search usually ignores punctuation that isn’t part of a search operator.
- Don’t put spaces between the symbol or word and your search term. A search for site:nytimes.com will work, but site: nytimes.com won’t.
