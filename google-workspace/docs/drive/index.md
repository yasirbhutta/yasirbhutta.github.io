## ☁️ **What is Cloud Storage?**

**Cloud storage** is a technology that allows you to **store data (files, documents, photos, videos, etc.) on remote servers** that are **accessed through the internet**, instead of saving them on your local computer or external drive.

These servers are maintained by **cloud service providers** (like Google, Amazon, or Microsoft), who manage the hardware, security, and availability of your data.

When you upload a file to a cloud storage service (like **Google Drive**, **Dropbox**, or **OneDrive**), it gets stored on their remote data centers. You can then **access, share, or edit** that file anytime and from anywhere — using your computer, phone, or tablet.
