# Compile Time vs Run Time: Key Differences Explained with Examples

Compile time and run time refer to different phases in the lifecycle of a program. Understanding these phases is crucial for debugging and optimizing your code.

## Compile Time

### Definition
Compile time is the phase when the source code is converted into machine code (or bytecode) by a compiler.

### Errors
Errors that occur at compile time are typically related to:
- Syntax issues (e.g., missing semicolons, incorrect syntax).
- Static type checks (in statically typed languages like Java or C++).
- Missing or incorrect declarations.

### Duration
This phase happens **before** the program is executed. In compiled languages like C, C++, and Java, the code must be compiled successfully before it can run.

### Key Point
The program **cannot run** if there are compile-time errors.

## Run Time

### Definition
Run time refers to the phase when the compiled code is executed by the machine or interpreter.

### Errors
Run-time errors occur while the program is being executed. These include:
- Logical errors.
- Exceptions (e.g., division by zero, file not found).
- Unexpected input or environmental conditions.

### Duration
This phase happens **after** the compilation phase (in compiled languages) or during interpretation (in interpreted languages like Python).

### Key Point
The program is actively running and performing tasks during this phase.

## Summary

| **Aspect**         | **Compile Time**                          | **Run Time**                          |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Definition**      | Code is converted into machine code.      | Code is executed by the machine.      |
| **Errors**          | Syntax and static type errors.            | Logical errors and exceptions.        |
| **Duration**        | Happens before execution.                 | Happens during execution.             |
| **Key Point**       | Program cannot run with compile-time errors. | Program actively performs tasks.      |

Understanding the differences between compile time and run time helps developers write efficient, error-free code and debug effectively.
