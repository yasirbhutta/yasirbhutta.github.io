📁 tests/ – Unit Tests for Reliability

Tests ensure the data processing, feature engineering, and models work correctly.

Suggested Tests

1. Data Integrity Checks:

Ensure expected columns exist

Check for missing values and duplicates

Validate correct data types



2. Data Processing Tests:

Ensure missing values are handled

Validate data transformations



3. Feature Engineering Tests:

Confirm new feature calculations are correct



4. Model Performance Checks:

Verify model accuracy is within expected range

Ensure predictions are valid (no NaNs)




Example Test File: tests/test_data_processing.py

import pandas as pd
import pytest
from src.data_preprocessing import clean_data  

def test_no_missing_values():
    df = pd.DataFrame({"A": [1, 2, None], "B": [4, 5, 6]})
    cleaned_df = clean_data(df)
    assert cleaned_df.isnull().sum().sum() == 0

Run tests with:

pytest tests/

📁 reports/ – Final Reports and Insights

This folder stores EDA reports, model evaluations, and visualizations.

Suggested Reports

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Report

Summary of dataset, missing values, distributions

Auto-generated using pandas-profiling


from pandas_profiling import ProfileReport
report = ProfileReport(df)
report.to_file("reports/eda_report.html")


2. Model Performance Report

Accuracy, precision-recall, confusion matrix

Save as model_evaluation.pdf



3. Final Summary Report

Key insights, trends, and business recommendations

Save as summary_findings.pdf



4. Visualization Reports

Store graphs and charts as PNG/JPG


import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  
plt.savefig("reports/plots/histogram.png")

✅ Best Practices

✔ Modular Code: Keep reusable functions in src/
✔ Version Control: Use Git for tracking changes
✔ Automated Testing: Run tests with pytest
✔ Clear Documentation: Write README and docstrings
✔ Automate Reports: Use Python scripts for report generation

This structure makes your project organized, scalable, and production-ready. Let me know if you need help setting up a template!
