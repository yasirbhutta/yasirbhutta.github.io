# **Structural Pattern Matching in Python (`match-case`): A Beginner’s Guide**  
*Learn how to simplify complex conditional logic with Python’s powerful `match-case` syntax!*

---

## **What is Structural Pattern Matching?**  
Introduced in Python 3.10, **`match-case`** is a modern way to handle data-driven decision-making. It goes beyond simple `if-elif-else` chains by letting you check the **structure** of data (like dictionaries, lists, or objects) and extract values from them. Think of it as a supercharged `switch` statement!

---

## **Why Use `match-case`?**  
- 🎯 **Cleaner code**: Replace messy nested `if` statements with readable patterns.  
- 💡 **Extract data**: Directly pull values from complex structures (e.g., JSON).  
- 🛠️ **Handle multiple cases**: Match data types, values, and even conditions in one block.

---

## **Basic Syntax**  
```python
match variable_to_check:
    case Pattern1:
        # Action for Pattern1
    case Pattern2:
        # Action for Pattern2
    case _:
        # Default action
```

---

## **Breaking Down the Example**  
Let’s dissect the sample code:

```python
def process_data(data):
    match data:
        # Case 1: Match a dictionary with "type": "alert" and extract "message"
        case {"type": "alert", "message": msg}:
            print(f"ALERT: {msg}")
        
        # Case 2: Match a list of 3 elements where the first > second
        case [x, y, z] if x > y:
            print(f"First element {x} is larger than {y}")
        
        # Case 3: Match integers or floats, capture as "num"
        case int() | float() as num:
            print(f"Number: {num}")
        
        # Default case: Handle anything else
        case _:
            print("Unknown format")
```

## **Real-World Examples**  

### 1. **Processing API Responses**  
Imagine handling JSON data from a weather API:  
```python
response = {
    "status": "success",
    "data": {"temp": 22, "city": "Paris"}
}

match response:
    case {"status": "success", "data": {"temp": t, "city": c}}:
        print(f"Temperature in {c}: {t}°C")
    case {"status": "error", "code": code}:
        print(f"API Error: Code {code}")
    case _:
        print("Unexpected response")
```

---

### 2. **Handling User Commands in a CLI App**  
Process commands like `add 5 3` or `delete user123`:  
```python
command = input("Enter command: ").split()

match command:
    case ["add", x, y]:
        print(f"Result: {int(x) + int(y)}")
    case ["delete", user_id]:
        print(f"Deleting user {user_id}...")
    case _:
        print("Invalid command")
```

---

### 3. **Game Event Handling**  
Manage events in a game (e.g., player actions):  
```python
event = {"type": "move", "direction": "north", "speed": 5}

match event:
    case {"type": "move", "direction": dir}:
        print(f"Player moved {dir}")
    case {"type": "attack", "damage": d} if d > 0:
        print(f"Dealt {d} damage!")
    case _:
        print("Unknown event")
```

---

## **Practice Tasks**  
Test your understanding with these exercises:

### **Task 1: Process Shapes**  
Given a list of shapes like `["circle", 5]` or `["rectangle", 3, 4]`, calculate their area:  
```python
shape = ["circle", 5]

match shape:
    case ["circle", radius]:
        print(f"Area: {3.14 * radius ** 2}")
    case ["rectangle", l, w]:
        print(f"Area: {l * w}")
    case _:
        print("Invalid shape")
```

---

### **Task 2: Validate User Input**  
Check if user input is a valid email or phone number:  
```python
user_input = "user@example.com"

match user_input.split("@"):
    case [name, domain]:
        print("Valid email!")
    case _ if user_input.isdigit() and len(user_input) == 10:
        print("Valid phone number!")
    case _:
        print("Invalid input")
```

---

### **Task 3: Parse Log Messages**  
Extract error levels and messages from log entries:  
```python
log = "ERROR: Disk full"

match log.split(": "):
    case ["ERROR", msg]:
        print(f"Critical error: {msg}")
    case ["WARNING", msg]:
        print(f"Warning: {msg}")
    case _:
        print("Unknown log type")
```

---

## **Key Takeaways**  
1. **Readability**: `match-case` makes complex logic easier to write and understand.  
2. **Patterns**: Match data structures (dicts, lists), types, and values in one go.  
3. **Extraction**: Pull values directly from patterns (e.g., `{"message": msg}`).  
4. **Guards**: Add conditions with `if` for finer control (e.g., `case [x, y] if x > y`).  

---

## **When to Use `match-case`**  
- Parsing JSON/API responses.  
- Handling commands in CLI apps.  
- Processing events in games or GUIs.  
- Validating structured data (forms, config files).

Introduction to Structural Pattern Matching (match-case) in Python

Structural Pattern Matching, introduced in Python 3.10, is a powerful way to write cleaner and more readable conditional logic. It is similar to switch-case statements in other languages but far more flexible. It allows you to match complex data structures such as dictionaries, lists, and even custom objects.

In this article, you'll learn:

Understanding Structural Pattern Matching (match-case)

In simple terms, Structural Pattern Matching lets you compare a variable against multiple patterns and execute code based on which pattern matches.

Syntax:

match variable:
    case pattern1:
        # Execute code for pattern1
    case pattern2:
        # Execute code for pattern2
    case _:
        # Default case (if nothing matches)

Basic Example: Handling Different Data Types

def check_value(value):
    match value:
        case 1:
            print("You entered one!")
        case "hello":
            print("You said hello!")
        case _:
            print("Unknown input")

check_value(1)       # Output: You entered one!
check_value("hello") # Output: You said hello!
check_value(42)      # Output: Unknown input

In this example, different cases handle different input values, and _ acts as the default case.

Advanced Examples of match-case

Matching Dictionaries (JSON-like data)

You can match dictionaries by their structure and extract values.

def process_data(data):
    match data:
        case {"type": "alert", "message": msg}:
            print(f"ALERT: {msg}")
        case {"type": "info", "details": details}:
            print(f"INFO: {details}")
        case _:
            print("Unknown format")

process_data({"type": "alert", "message": "Low battery!"})
# Output: ALERT: Low battery!

Here, match checks if data is a dictionary with specific keys.


---

Matching Lists and Tuples

def check_sequence(seq):
    match seq:
        case [x, y, z] if x > y:
            print(f"First element {x} is greater than {y}")
        case [x, y, z]:
            print(f"Three elements found: {x}, {y}, {z}")
        case _:
            print("Unknown sequence")

check_sequence([10, 5, 2])  # Output: First element 10 is greater than 5
check_sequence([1, 2, 3])   # Output: Three elements found: 1, 2, 3

This allows structured unpacking and conditional matching.


---

Matching Data Types

def identify_value(value):
    match value:
        case int() | float() as num:
            print(f"Number: {num}")
        case str() as text:
            print(f"String: {text}")
        case _:
            print("Unknown type")

identify_value(3.14)   # Output: Number: 3.14
identify_value("Hey")  # Output: String: Hey

This case matches data types and assigns them to variables.


---

Real-World Applications of Structural Pattern Matching

1. Parsing JSON Data (API Responses)

APIs often return JSON data with different structures. match-case helps process them effectively.

def api_response_handler(response):
    match response:
        case {"status": "error", "message": msg}:
            print(f"Error: {msg}")
        case {"status": "success", "data": data}:
            print(f"Success! Data: {data}")
        case _:
            print("Unexpected response format")

api_response_handler({"status": "success", "data": {"user": "Alice"}})
# Output: Success! Data: {'user': 'Alice'}


---

2. Command Processing (Chatbots, CLI)

def process_command(command):
    match command.split():
        case ["add", x, y]:
            print(f"Adding {x} and {y}")
        case ["exit"]:
            print("Goodbye!")
        case _:
            print("Invalid command")

process_command("add 5 10")  # Output: Adding 5 and 10
process_command("exit")      # Output: Goodbye!

This is useful for chatbots and command-line applications.


---

3. Event Handling in GUI Applications

def handle_event(event):
    match event:
        case {"type": "click", "x": x, "y": y}:
            print(f"Click at ({x}, {y})")
        case {"type": "keypress", "key": key}:
            print(f"Key pressed: {key}")
        case _:
            print("Unknown event")

handle_event({"type": "click", "x": 50, "y": 100})
# Output: Click at (50, 100)

This helps in GUI programming for event handling.


---

Tasks for Practice

Try solving these problems using match-case:

1. Student Grading System:
Write a function that takes a student's marks and matches it to a grade:

marks >= 90 → "Grade: A"

marks >= 80 → "Grade: B"

marks >= 70 → "Grade: C"

Else → "Fail"



2. E-commerce Order Processing:
Match an order dictionary with:

{"status": "shipped", "tracking": "XYZ123"} → Print tracking number

{"status": "delivered"} → Print "Order delivered"

Default → "Invalid order"



3. Weather Alerts:
Match different weather conditions ({"temp": temp, "condition": "rainy"}) and print appropriate messages.
