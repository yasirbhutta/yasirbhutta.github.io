## Tips for Practicing

- **Practice Coding by Hand:** This will help you think through the problem deeply.
- **Focus on Understanding:** Don’t just memorize solutions; focus on understanding the underlying concepts.
- **Explain Your Solution:** Try to explain your solution to someone else, or write comments in your code as if you’re explaining it.
- **Use Online Platforms:** Platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and Codeforces are excellent for finding a wide range of problems to practice.
