## **Objective:**
Create an interactive console-based tool that allows users to input strings and perform various string operations, such as reversing, formatting, replacing substrings, counting occurrences of characters, and more.

## **Features:**
1. **Reverse a String**  
   Allow the user to input a string and reverse it.

2. **Convert to Uppercase and Lowercase**  
   Provide options to convert the string to either all uppercase or all lowercase.

3. **Count Vowels and Consonants**  
   Count and display the number of vowels and consonants in the input string.

4. **Replace a Substring**  
   Allow the user to replace a specific substring within the string with another substring.

5. **Format Title Case**  
   Convert the input string into title case (capitalize the first letter of each word).

6. **Remove Extra Spaces**  
   Remove any extra spaces from the input string, ensuring only single spaces between words.

7. **Check for Palindrome**  
   Check if the string is a palindrome, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and case sensitivity.

8. **Word Count**  
   Count and display the number of words in the input string.

#### **How the Tool Works:**
1. **User Input:** The tool will prompt the user to enter a string of their choice.
2. **Select Operation:** The user can select from the listed string operations by choosing the corresponding number.
3. **Display Result:** The result of the selected operation will be displayed immediately, and the user can perform additional operations or exit the tool.
4. **Exit:** The tool will continue to run until the user decides to exit.

#### **Example Interaction:**
```
