This project uses **lists** and **tuples** to store and manage student records, including their names and grades.  

## **1. Data Structure**  
- A **list** (`students`) stores all student records.  
- Each student is represented as a **tuple** (`(name, grades)`), where:  
  - `name` â†’ String (student's name)  
  - `grades` â†’ List of numbers (student's grades)  

## **2. Functions**  

### **1. `add_student()`**  
- Takes input for student name and grades.  
- Appends the student record (`(name, grades)`) to the `students` list.  

### **2. `calculate_average(grades)`**  
- Takes a list of grades and returns the average.  
- Handles empty lists (returns `0`).  

### **3. `display_students()`**  
- Prints all student records in a formatted way:  
  ```
  Name: Alice | Grades: [90, 85, 95] | Average: 90.00
  Name: Bob   | Grades: [75, 80, 70]  | Average: 75.00
  ```

### **4. `top_performers()`**  
- Computes averages for all students.  
- Sorts students by average (descending order).  
- Displays the top 3 students.  

### **5. `main()` (Menu-Driven Program)**  
- Displays a menu:  
  ```
  1. Add Student  
  2. View All Students  
  3. View Top Performers  
  4. Exit  
  ```  
- Takes user input and calls the appropriate function.  

## **3. Execution Flow**  
1. Initialize `students = []` (empty list).  
2. Call `main()`, which runs in a loop until the user exits.

### **Why Review the Solution?**  
âœ” **Compare your approach** â€“ Did you implement it differently?  
âœ” **Debug faster** â€“ Spot mistakes by cross-checking logic.  
âœ” **Learn best practices** â€“ See clean code formatting and efficient list/tuple usage.  

ðŸ’¡ **Pro Tip:** Try building the project yourself first, then compare with the solution for maximum learning!

### **Key Takeaways**  
âœ… **Lists** store multiple student records.  
âœ… **Tuples** hold individual student data (name + grades).  
âœ… Functions perform operations like adding, displaying, and ranking students.  
âœ… Menu-driven interaction makes it user-friendly.  

This structure helps beginners understand how to **organize data** using lists and tuples effectively. ðŸš€
