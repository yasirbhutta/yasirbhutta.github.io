## What is `pip`?

`pip` is the standard package manager for Python that allows you to install and manage additional libraries that aren't part of the standard Python library.

## Checking if `pip` is Installed

Before using `pip`, check if it's already installed (it usually comes with Python 3.4+):

```bash
pip --version
```

or 

```bash
pip3 --version
```

## Basic `pip` Commands

### Installing a Package

```bash
pip install package_name
```

Example:
```bash
pip install requests
```

### Installing a Specific Version

```bash
pip install package_name==version_number
```

Example:
```bash
pip install requests==2.25.1
```

### Upgrading a Package

```bash
pip install --upgrade package_name
```

Example:
```bash
pip install --upgrade requests
```

### Uninstalling a Package

```bash
pip uninstall package_name
```

Example:
```bash
pip uninstall requests
```

### Listing Installed Packages

```bash
pip list
```

### Showing Package Information

```bash
pip show package_name
```

Example:
```bash
pip show requests
```

## Practical Examples of Using External Libraries

### Example 1: Making HTTP Requests with `requests`

```python
import requests

# Make a GET request to a website
response = requests.get('https://www.example.com')

# Check if the request was successful
if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Successfully fetched the page!")
    print(f"Page content length: {len(response.text)} characters")
else:
    print(f"Failed to fetch page. Status code: {response.status_code}")
```

### Example 2: Working with Dates using `python-dateutil`

```python
from dateutil import parser
from dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta

# Parse a date string
date = parser.parse("June 5th 2023 10:30 PM")
print(f"Parsed date: {date}")

# Add 2 months to the date
new_date = date + relativedelta(months=+2)
print(f"Date after adding 2 months: {new_date}")
```

### Example 3: Data Visualization with `matplotlib`

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample data
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

# Create a simple line plot
plt.plot(x, y)

# Add labels and title
plt.xlabel('X Axis')
plt.ylabel('Y Axis')
plt.title('Simple Line Plot')

# Display the plot
plt.show()
```

### Example 4: Working with Excel Files using `openpyxl`

```python
from openpyxl import Workbook

# Create a new Excel workbook
wb = Workbook()

# Get the active worksheet
ws = wb.active

# Add some data
ws['A1'] = "Name"
ws['B1'] = "Age"
ws['A2'] = "Alice"
ws['B2'] = 25
ws['A3'] = "Bob"
ws['B3'] = 30

# Save the workbook
wb.save("sample.xlsx")
print("Excel file created successfully!")
```

### Example 5: Web Scraping with `beautifulsoup4`

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Fetch a webpage
url = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)'
response = requests.get(url)

# Parse the HTML content
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')

# Extract and print the page title
title = soup.find('h1').text
print(f"Page title: {title}")

# Extract and print the first paragraph
first_paragraph = soup.find('p').text
print(f"\nFirst paragraph:\n{first_paragraph}")
```

## Virtual Environments (Bonus)

For project-specific dependencies, it's good practice to use virtual environments:

1. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv myenv
```

2. Activate it:
- On Windows:
```bash
myenv\Scripts\activate
```
- On macOS/Linux:
```bash
source myenv/bin/activate
```

3. Now install packages within this environment:
```bash
pip install package_name
```

4. Deactivate when done:
```bash
deactivate
```

## Requirements Files

You can save all your project's dependencies to a file:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

And later install them all at once:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Conclusion

Using external libraries with `pip` greatly expands what you can do with Python. Start with simple libraries like `requests` or `matplotlib`, and gradually explore more specialized ones as you need them for your projects.
