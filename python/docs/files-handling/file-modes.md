Understanding file modes is essential when working with files in Python. File modes determine how you can interact with a file - whether you can read from it, write to it, or both. Let's explore each mode with simple examples.

## Basic File Modes

### 1. Read Mode (`'r'`)
- Opens a file for reading (default mode)
- File must exist
- You cannot modify the file

```python
# Example: Reading a diary entry
with open('diary.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print("My Diary Entry:")
    print(content)
```

**Real-world analogy**: Like opening a book to read it (you can't write in it).

### 2. Write Mode (`'w'`)
- Opens a file for writing
- Creates the file if it doesn't exist
- **Erases all existing content** if the file exists

```python
# Example: Creating a shopping list (overwrites any existing list)
with open('shopping_list.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write("1. Milk\n")
    file.write("2. Eggs\n")
    file.write("3. Bread\n")
```

**Real-world analogy**: Like getting a brand new notebook - if one exists with the same name, it gets thrown away first.

### 3. Append Mode (`'a'`)
- Opens a file for writing
- Creates the file if it doesn't exist
- New content is added at the end (preserves existing content)

```python
# Example: Adding to a shopping list
with open('shopping_list.txt', 'a') as file:
    file.write("4. Apples\n")
    file.write("5. Chicken\n")
```

**Real-world analogy**: Like adding new pages to an existing notebook without removing old pages.

## Combined Modes

### 4. Read and Write Mode (`'r+'`)
- Opens a file for both reading and writing
- File must exist
- Writing starts at the beginning (can overwrite existing content)

```python
# Example: Updating a score file
with open('scores.txt', 'r+') as file:
    content = file.read()
    if "High Score: 50" in content:
        # Move back to start to overwrite
        file.seek(0)
        file.write("High Score: 100")
```

**Real-world analogy**: Like having a whiteboard where you can both read what's written and modify it.

### 5. Write and Read Mode (`'w+'`)
- Opens a file for both writing and reading
- Creates the file if it doesn't exist
- **Erases all existing content** if the file exists

```python
# Example: Creating and immediately reading a note
with open('quick_note.txt', 'w+') as file:
    file.write("Remember to call mom!")
    file.seek(0)  # Go back to start to read
    print(file.read())
```

**Real-world analogy**: Like getting a brand new whiteboard where you can write and then immediately read what you wrote.

## Special Modes

### 6. Binary Modes (`'rb'`, `'wb'`, `'ab'`, etc.)
- Used for non-text files (images, executables, etc.)
- Add `'b'` to any mode (like `'rb'` or `'wb'`)

```python
# Example: Copying an image
with open('photo.jpg', 'rb') as source:
    with open('photo_copy.jpg', 'wb') as target:
        target.write(source.read())
```

**Real-world analogy**: Like working with the raw data of a file rather than its text content.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Trying to read a file opened in write mode**:
   ```python
   with open('example.txt', 'w') as file:
       print(file.read())  # Error! Can't read in 'w' mode
   ```

2. **Opening a non-existent file in read mode**:
   ```python
   with open('nonexistent.txt', 'r') as file:  # FileNotFoundError
       content = file.read()
   ```

3. **Forgetting that 'w' mode erases the file**:
   ```python
   # This will delete all existing content!
   with open('important_data.txt', 'w') as file:
       file.write("New content")
   ```

## Practical Example: Simple User Database

```python
# Adding a new user (append mode)
def add_user(username, password):
    with open('users.txt', 'a') as file:
        file.write(f"{username},{password}\n")

# Checking user login (read mode)
def check_login(username, password):
    with open('users.txt', 'r') as file:
        for line in file:
            stored_user, stored_pass = line.strip().split(',')
            if stored_user == username and stored_pass == password:
                return True
    return False

# Usage
add_user("alice", "secure123")
add_user("bob", "password456")

print(check_login("alice", "secure123"))  # True
print(check_login("eve", "hacker123"))    # False
```

Remember to always choose the right mode for your task to avoid accidentally losing data or getting errors!
