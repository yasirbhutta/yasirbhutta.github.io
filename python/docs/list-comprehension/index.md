## 1. What is List Comprehension?

List comprehensions are a shorter and cleaner way to create lists. Instead of writing multiple lines with a for loop, you can do the same in just one line.

## 2. Why Use List Comprehension?

1. **Readability**: Once you're familiar with the syntax, list comprehensions are often more readable than equivalent loop constructs.
2. **Conciseness**: They allow you to express complex operations in a single line.
3. **Performance**: List comprehensions can be slightly faster than equivalent `for` loops in many cases.
4. **Pythonic**: They are considered a more "Pythonic" way to create lists.

## 3. Basic Syntax

```python
[expression for item in iterable if condition]
```

- `expression`: What you want to do with each item
- `item`: The variable representing each element in the iterable
- `iterable`: The sequence you're looping through (list, tuple, string, etc.)
- `condition` (optional): Filters which items to include

## 4. Examples for Beginners

### Example 1: Basic transformation
```python
# Traditional way
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
squares = []
for num in numbers:
    squares.append(num ** 2)

# With list comprehension
squares = [num ** 2 for num in numbers]
# Result: [1, 4, 9, 16]
```

[Python List Comprehension Tutorial ‚Äì Easy Code Example and Video for Beginners](../../videos/list-comprehension.md)

### Example 2: Filtering
```python
# Only even numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
evens = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
# Result: [2, 4, 6]
```

üîé means: ‚ÄúFrom numbers 1 to 6, pick x only if x is even‚Äù

### Example 3: Combining transformation and filtering
```python
# Squares of even numbers only
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
even_squares = [num ** 2 for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
# Result: [4, 16, 36]
```

## 5. Real-Life Usage Examples

### 1. Processing user input
```python
# Convert comma-separated string to list of integers
user_input = "1, 2, 3, 4, five, 6"
numbers = [int(x.strip()) for x in user_input.split(',') if x.strip().isdigit()]
# Result: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6]
```

### 2. Data cleaning
```python
# Remove empty strings and strip whitespace
data = [" apple ", "banana", "  ", "cherry ", ""]
clean_data = [fruit.strip() for fruit in data if fruit.strip()]
# Result: ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
```

### 3. Working with files
```python
# Read lines from a file and remove newline characters
with open('data.txt') as file:
    lines = [line.strip() for line in file]
```

### 4. Matrix operations
```python
# Transpose a matrix (swap rows and columns)
matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
transposed = [[row[i] for row in matrix] for i in range(3)]
# Result: [[1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [3, 6, 9]]
```

### 5. API response processing
```python
# Extract specific fields from API response
api_response = [
    {"id": 1, "name": "Alice", "active": True},
    {"id": 2, "name": "Bob", "active": False},
    {"id": 3, "name": "Charlie", "active": True}
]

active_users = [user["name"] for user in api_response if user["active"]]
# Result: ["Alice", "Charlie"]
```

## 6. When Not to Use List Comprehension

While list comprehensions are powerful, they're not always the best choice:
- When the logic is too complex (becomes hard to read)
- When you need to use multiple conditions that would make the comprehension too long
- When you need to include side effects (like printing) during iteration

In these cases, a traditional `for` loop might be more appropriate.

## Tasks

### **Task 1: Square all numbers**

Create a list of numbers from 1 to 10. Use list comprehension to generate a new list with the square of each number.

```python
# Expected Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
```

[Video Solution](../../videos/list-comprehension.md)

---

#### **Task 2: Filter odd numbers**

From a list of numbers, create a new list containing only the odd numbers using list comprehension.

```python
# Input: [10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35]
# Expected Output: [15, 25, 35]
```

---

#### **Task 3: Cube of even numbers**

Use list comprehension to get the cube of even numbers from the list.

```python
# Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
# Expected Output: [8, 64, 216]
```

---

#### **Task 4: Multiply by 10 if number is divisible by 5**

Write a list comprehension to multiply only the numbers divisible by 5 by 10.

```python
# Input: [5, 8, 10, 13, 20, 21]
# Expected Output: [50, 100, 200]
```

---

#### **Task 5: Replace even numbers with "Even"**

Replace all even numbers in a list with the string `"Even"` using list comprehension.

```python
# Input: [3, 6, 9, 12, 15]
# Expected Output: [3, 'Even', 9, 'Even', 15]
```

---

#### **Task 6: Create a list of first letters**

Given a list of names, create a list of the first letter of each name using list comprehension.

```python
# Input: ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
# Expected Output: ['A', 'B', 'C']
```

---

#### **Task 7: Convert all strings to uppercase**

Convert each string in a list to uppercase using list comprehension.

```python
# Input: ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
# Expected Output: ["APPLE", "BANANA", "CHERRY"]
```
