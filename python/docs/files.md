# Working with files in Python

## 1. **Reading and Writing Files**
   - Python provides simple methods to read from and write to files using the built-in `open()` function.
   - You can open files in different modes like read (`r`), write (`w`), and append (`a`).

   #### Reading a File:
   - Use `open()` with mode `'r'` to read from a file.
   - Use `.read()` to read the entire file or `.readlines()` to read the file line by line.

   Example of reading a file:
   ```python
   with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
       content = file.read()
       print(content)
   ```

   #### Writing to a File:
   - Use `open()` with mode `'w'` to write to a file. This will overwrite the file if it exists.
   - Use `'a'` to append content to an existing file.

   Example of writing to a file:
   ```python
   with open('example.txt', 'w') as file:
       file.write("Hello, this is a test file.\n")
       file.write("Python makes file handling easy.")
   ```

   ### 2. **Handling File Exceptions**
   - You should always handle potential errors when working with files, such as file not found or permission issues.
   - You can use a `try` and `except` block to handle these exceptions.

   Example:
   ```python
   try:
       with open('nonexistent_file.txt', 'r') as file:
           content = file.read()
   except FileNotFoundError:
       print("The file was not found.")
   ```

### 3. **Reading User Input**
   - You can use the `input()` function to capture user input.
   - By default, `input()` returns a string, so you may need to convert it to another data type (e.g., `int()` or `float()`).

   Example:
   ```python
   name = input("Enter your name: ")
   age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
   print(f"Hello {name}, you are {age} years old.")
   ```

### 4. **Writing User Input to a File**
   - Combine reading user input with file writing. Ask the user for input and save their response to a file.

   Example:
   ```python
   user_input = input("Enter some text to save to the file: ")
   with open('user_input.txt', 'w') as file:
       file.write(user_input)
   ```
