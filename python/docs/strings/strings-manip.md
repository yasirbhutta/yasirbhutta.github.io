## What is a String?
- A **string** is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes.
  - Examples: `"hello"`, `'Python'`, `"1234"`

### Creating Strings:
```python
name = "Alice"
greeting = 'Hello'
```

### Common String Operations:
1. **Concatenation (joining strings):**
   ```python
   first = "Hello"
   second = "World"
   result = first + " " + second  # Output: "Hello World"
   ```

2. **Repetition:**
   ```python
   word = "Hi"
   print(word * 3)  # Output: "HiHiHi"
   ```

3. **Indexing:**
   ```python
   text = "Python"
   print(text[0])  # Output: "P"
   print(text[-1]) # Output: "n"
   ```

4. **Slicing:**
   ```python
   text = "Python"
   print(text[0:3])  # Output: "Pyt"
   print(text[2:])   # Output: "thon"
   ```
