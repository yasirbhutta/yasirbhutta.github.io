## **1. Project: String Manipulation Tool**

#### **Objective:**
Create an interactive console-based tool that allows users to input strings and perform various string operations, such as reversing, formatting, replacing substrings, counting occurrences of characters, and more.

#### **Features:**
1. **Reverse a String**  
   Allow the user to input a string and reverse it.

2. **Convert to Uppercase and Lowercase**  
   Provide options to convert the string to either all uppercase or all lowercase.

3. **Count Vowels and Consonants**  
   Count and display the number of vowels and consonants in the input string.

4. **Replace a Substring**  
   Allow the user to replace a specific substring within the string with another substring.

5. **Format Title Case**  
   Convert the input string into title case (capitalize the first letter of each word).

6. **Remove Extra Spaces**  
   Remove any extra spaces from the input string, ensuring only single spaces between words.

7. **Check for Palindrome**  
   Check if the string is a palindrome, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and case sensitivity.

8. **Word Count**  
   Count and display the number of words in the input string.

#### **How the Tool Works:**
1. **User Input:** The tool will prompt the user to enter a string of their choice.
2. **Select Operation:** The user can select from the listed string operations by choosing the corresponding number.
3. **Display Result:** The result of the selected operation will be displayed immediately, and the user can perform additional operations or exit the tool.
4. **Exit:** The tool will continue to run until the user decides to exit.

#### **Example Interaction:**
```
Welcome to the String Manipulation Tool!
Choose an operation:
1. Reverse a string
2. Convert to uppercase
3. Convert to lowercase
4. Count vowels and consonants
5. Replace a substring
6. Format title case
7. Remove extra spaces
8. Check if the string is a palindrome
9. Count words in a string
10. Exit
Enter the number of your choice: 1
Enter a string: Hello, World!
Reversed string: !dlroW ,olleH
```

Absolutely! Here's a beginner-friendly **Mini Project** based on string formatting that ties together the concepts of `find()`, `replace()`, `split()`, and `partition()`.

## üéØ **2. Mini Project: String Formatter Toolkit**

### üìñ **Objective**

To build a **menu-driven Python program** that allows users to perform different string operations like:
- Finding a substring
- Replacing words
- Splitting into words
- Partitioning a string

This helps students:
- Practice string manipulation
- Write interactive programs
- Use conditionals and loops

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **Features to Implement**

1. **Input a sentence**
2. **Display a menu with options:**
   ```
   1. Find a word
   2. Replace a word
   3. Split into words
   4. Partition at a word
   5. Exit
   ```

3. **Perform the operation based on user choice**
4. **Repeat until the user chooses to exit**

---

### üßë‚Äçüíª **Sample Code Skeleton**

```python
print("Welcome to the String Formatter Toolkit!")
sentence = input("Enter a sentence: ")

while True:
    print("\nWhat would you like to do?")
    print("1. Find a word")
    print("2. Replace a word")
    print("3. Split into words")
    print("4. Partition at a word")
    print("5. Exit")

    choice = input("Enter your choice (1-5): ")

    if choice == '1':
        word = input("Enter the word to find: ")
        pos = sentence.find(word)
        if pos != -1:
            print(f"'{word}' found at position {pos}")
        else:
            print(f"'{word}' not found.")

    elif choice == '2':
        old = input("Word to replace: ")
        new = input("New word: ")
        sentence = sentence.replace(old, new)
        print("Updated sentence:", sentence)

    elif choice == '3':
        words = sentence.split()
        print("Words in sentence:", words)

    elif choice == '4':
        sep = input("Enter the word to partition by: ")
        before, middle, after = sentence.partition(sep)
        print("Before:", before)
        print("Separator:", middle)
        print("After:", after)

    elif choice == '5':
        print("Goodbye!")
        break

    else:
        print("Invalid choice. Please enter a number from 1 to 5.")
```

### üìù **Expected Output Example**

```
Welcome to the String Formatter Toolkit!
Enter a sentence: Python is easy and fun to learn

What would you like to do?
1. Find a word
2. Replace a word
3. Split into words
4. Partition at a word
5. Exit
Enter your choice (1-5): 1
Enter the word to find: fun
'fun' found at position 19
```

---

### üìö **Learning Outcomes**

- Understand and apply string methods (`find`, `replace`, `split`, `partition`)
- Use loops and conditionals effectively
- Build confidence writing interactive programs
