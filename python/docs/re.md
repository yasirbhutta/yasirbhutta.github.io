# **Regular Expressions (Regex)** in Python

Regular expressions are powerful tools for searching, matching, and manipulating strings based on patterns.

### 1. **Introduction to Regular Expressions**
   - The `re` module in Python provides functions for working with regular expressions.
   - You can use regular expressions to:
     - Search for specific patterns within a string.
     - Replace parts of a string that match a pattern.
     - Split strings based on patterns.

### 2. **Basic Functions in the `re` module**

   - **`re.match()`**: Checks if the regular expression matches the beginning of the string.
     ```python
     import re
     result = re.match(r'Hello', 'Hello, world!')
     print(result)  # Output: <re.Match object; span=(0, 5), match='Hello'>
     ```

   - **`re.search()`**: Searches for the first location where the regular expression matches.
     ```python
     result = re.search(r'world', 'Hello, world!')
     print(result)  # Output: <re.Match object; span=(7, 12), match='world'>
     ```

   - **`re.findall()`**: Returns a list of all non-overlapping matches of the regular expression in the string.
     ```python
     result = re.findall(r'\d+', 'There are 12 apples and 34 oranges')
     print(result)  # Output: ['12', '34']
     ```

   - **`re.sub()`**: Replaces occurrences of the pattern with a specified string.
     ```python
     result = re.sub(r'apples', 'bananas', 'There are 12 apples and 34 oranges')
     print(result)  # Output: There are 12 bananas and 34 oranges
     ```

### 3. **Special Characters in Regular Expressions**
   - `.`: Matches any character except a newline.
   - `^`: Matches the start of the string.
   - `$`: Matches the end of the string.
   - `[]`: Matches any single character inside the brackets.
   - `|`: Acts as a logical OR operator.
   - `\d`: Matches any digit (equivalent to `[0-9]`).
   - `\w`: Matches any alphanumeric character (equivalent to `[a-zA-Z0-9_]`).
   - `+`: Matches 1 or more occurrences of the preceding character or group.
   - `*`: Matches 0 or more occurrences of the preceding character or group.

### 4. **Examples**
   - **Extracting digits from a string**:
     ```python
     text = "The price is 50 dollars"
     numbers = re.findall(r'\d+', text)
     print(numbers)  # Output: ['50']
     ```

   - **Checking if a string starts with a certain word**:
     ```python
     text = "Hello, world!"
     if re.match(r'^Hello', text):
         print("String starts with 'Hello'")
     ```

   - **Validating an email address**:
     ```python
     email = "test@example.com"
     if re.match(r'^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$', email):
         print("Valid email")
     else:
         print("Invalid email")
     ```
