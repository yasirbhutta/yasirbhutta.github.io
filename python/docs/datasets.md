from sklearn.datasets import load_wine
wine = load_wine()
print(wine.data)

Diabetes Dataset: A small dataset for regression tasks related to diabetes progression.

from sklearn.datasets import load_diabetes
diabetes = load_diabetes()
print(diabetes.data)

Breast Cancer Dataset: Suitable for binary classification tasks.

from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
cancer = load_breast_cancer()
print(cancer.data)

Boston Housing Dataset (deprecated): Previously used for regression analysis, but now deprecated due to ethical concerns.


2. Seaborn Datasets

Seaborn provides a variety of datasets for visualization and analysis, which can be easily loaded.

Titanic Dataset: Useful for classification and visualization tasks.

import seaborn as sns
titanic = sns.load_dataset('titanic')
print(titanic.head())

Tips Dataset: Ideal for regression analysis and exploratory data visualization.

tips = sns.load_dataset('tips')
print(tips.head())

Flights Dataset: Time series data showing monthly passengers.

flights = sns.load_dataset('flights')
print(flights.head())

Penguins Dataset: A dataset for classification and visualization tasks related to penguin species.

penguins = sns.load_dataset('penguins')
print(penguins.head())


3. Statsmodels Datasets

Statsmodels provides access to real-world datasets for statistical analysis.

Heart Disease Dataset: For binary classification and logistic regression tasks.

import statsmodels.api as sm
heart = sm.datasets.heart.load_pandas().data
print(heart.head())

Fair’s Affairs Dataset: Useful for logistic regression and social science analysis.

fair = sm.datasets.fair.load_pandas().data
print(fair.head())

US States Dataset: Data on the population and area of US states for regression tasks.

states = sm.datasets.statecrime.load_pandas().data
print(states.head())


4. Pandas Built-in Datasets

Pandas itself doesn’t have built-in datasets, but you can easily load datasets from CSV, Excel, or other formats.

Reading from a URL (e.g., Titanic Dataset):

import pandas as pd
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasciencedojo/datasets/master/titanic.csv"
titanic = pd.read_csv(url)
print(titanic.head())


5. Kaggle Datasets via Python API

You can use the Kaggle API to download datasets from Kaggle directly into your environment.

1. Install the Kaggle package:

pip install kaggle


2. Download a dataset:

!kaggle datasets download -d shivamb/netflix-shows



6. TensorFlow Datasets (for deep learning)

TensorFlow provides datasets for machine learning and deep learning tasks.

MNIST Dataset: A collection of handwritten digits for image classification.

import tensorflow as tf
mnist = tf.keras.datasets.mnist
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()
print(x_train.shape)

CIFAR-10 Dataset: Image dataset for object recognition tasks.

cifar10 = tf.keras.datasets.cifar10
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = cifar10.load_data()
print(x_train.shape)


These built-in datasets in Python libraries provide excellent starting points for learning data analysis, machine learning, and visualization skills. You can access them without needing to download any external data.
