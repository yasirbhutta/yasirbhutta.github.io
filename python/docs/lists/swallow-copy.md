In Python, a **shallow copy** is a new object that is a **copy of the original object**, but it **does not create copies of nested objects** (objects inside objects). Instead, it only copies references to those inner objects.

---

## 1. ‚úÖ What is a Shallow Copy?

* It copies the outer object.
* Inner elements (like lists or dictionaries inside a list) are **not copied**, only their **references** are copied.
* Changes to nested objects in the copied object **affect the original**.

---

## 2. üìå How to Create a Shallow Copy

1. **Using `copy()` method (for lists, dicts, etc.):**

```python
original = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
shallow = original.copy()
```

2. **Using the `copy` module:**

```python
import copy
shallow = copy.copy(original)
```

---

## 3. üîç Example:

```python
import copy

original = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
shallow = copy.copy(original)

shallow[0][0] = 100

print("Original:", original)  # [[100, 2], [3, 4]]
print("Shallow:", shallow)    # [[100, 2], [3, 4]]
```

‚úÖ The outer list is copied.
‚ùå The inner lists are **shared**, so modifying `shallow[0][0]` changes `original[0][0]`.

---

Here's a line-by-line explanation of the code:

---

### üî∏ Code:

```python
import copy
```

‚úÖ This imports Python‚Äôs built-in `copy` module, which provides functions to perform shallow and deep copies.

---

```python
original = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
```

‚úÖ A list named `original` is created. It contains **two inner lists**, making it a nested list (a list of lists).

---

```python
shallow = copy.copy(original)
```

‚úÖ This creates a **shallow copy** of `original` and stores it in `shallow`.

* A **new outer list** is created.
* The **inner lists are not copied**; only their **references** are copied.

So now:

* `original` and `shallow` are two different outer lists.
* But `original[0]` and `shallow[0]` point to the **same inner list** `[1, 2]`.

---

```python
shallow[0][0] = 100
```

‚úÖ This changes the first element of the first inner list **through the shallow copy**.

Since the inner list `[1, 2]` is **shared** between `original` and `shallow`, the change affects both.

---

```python
print("Original:", original)  # [[100, 2], [3, 4]]
print("Shallow:", shallow)    # [[100, 2], [3, 4]]
```

‚úÖ Output shows that **both `original` and `shallow` are affected**:

```
Original: [[100, 2], [3, 4]]
Shallow:  [[100, 2], [3, 4]]
```

### üîç Summary:

* `copy.copy()` only copies the outer list.
* The inner lists are **shared** between `original` and `shallow`.
* Changes to inner lists in the copy will **affect the original**.

---

## 4. ‚úÖ When to Use Shallow Copy

Use shallow copy when:

* You want a new outer container.
* You don‚Äôt plan to modify nested objects separately.
