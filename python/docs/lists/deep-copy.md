## 1. 🧠 What is a **Deep Copy** in Python?

A **deep copy** creates a **completely independent copy** of an object **and all nested objects inside it**.

> Changes made to the original object **do not affect** the deep copy, and vice versa.

---

## 2. ✅ Why Use Deep Copy?

When your object contains **nested structures** like:

* Lists of lists
* Dictionaries of dictionaries
* Objects containing other objects

…and you want **totally independent copies**, use deep copy.

---

## 3. 📦 How to Make a Deep Copy?

Use the `copy` module:

```python
import copy

deep_copy_object = copy.deepcopy(original_object)
```

---

## 4. 🔍 Beginner-Friendly Example:

```python
import copy

original = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
deep = copy.deepcopy(original)

# Modify deep copy
deep[0][0] = 100

print("Original:", original)  # Output: [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
print("Deep Copy:", deep)     # Output: [[100, 2], [3, 4]]
```

✅ Here, changing `deep[0][0]` **does not affect** the original list.

## 5. 🔁 Comparison: Shallow vs Deep Copy

| Feature          | Shallow Copy (`copy.copy()`) | Deep Copy (`copy.deepcopy()`) |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Copies top-level | ✅                            | ✅                             |
| Copies nested    | ❌ (references only)          | ✅ (real copies)               |
| Independent?     | ❌                            | ✅                             |

## 6. 🧪 Another Example: Dictionary with Nested List

```python
import copy

original = {'a': [1, 2]}
deep = copy.deepcopy(original)

deep['a'][0] = 100

print("Original:", original)  # {'a': [1, 2]}
print("Deep Copy:", deep)     # {'a': [100, 2]}
```

* **What is a Shallow Copy** – In Python, a **shallow copy** is a new object that is a **copy of the original object**, but it **does not create copies of nested objects** (objects inside objects).
