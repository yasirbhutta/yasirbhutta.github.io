### 📝 Exercise 1:
Create a class `Employee` with a method `work()`.  
Create a class `Manager` that inherits from `Employee` and adds a method `manage()`.

### 📝 Exercise 2:
Create a class `Teacher` that inherits from `Person`.  
Override the `introduce()` method to say:  
`"Hello, I'm Mr./Ms. [name] and I teach students."`

### 📝 Exercise 3:
In the `Teacher` class, use `super()` inside `introduce()` so it also prints the original greeting.

Exercise 1: Create a Vehicle class and a Car class that inherits from it. Add a method to the Car class to display the car's brand.

Exercise 2: Override a method in the Car class to display a custom message.
