## Module 1: Getting Started
   
### Lesson 1: Python IDE Installation

This class focuses on installing a Python Integrated Development Environment (IDE) using a task-based approach. An IDE provides a comprehensive environment for writing, editing, and running Python code, including features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and debugging tools.

**Learning Objectives:**

* Understand the benefits of using an IDE for Python development.
* Identify popular Python IDE options.
* Install a chosen Python IDE on your operating system.
* Verify successful installation and run a simple Python program.

**Task 1: Choosing an IDE**

- Choose a Python IDE of your choice for coding.

There are several excellent Python IDEs available, each with its own strengths and features. Here are a few popular options:

* **Visual Studio Code (VS Code):** A free, open-source, and lightweight code editor with excellent Python support through extensions. 
* **PyCharm:** A powerful, feature-rich IDE with strong debugging and project management tools (free Community Edition or paid Professional Edition).
* **IDLE:** The default IDE included with the standard Python installation (lightweight but offers basic features). [Learn more ...](tools.md) 

**Consider these factors when choosing an IDE:**

* **Experience Level:** Beginner, intermediate, or advanced?
* **Features:** Syntax highlighting, code completion, debugging, version control, etc.
* **Platform:** Windows, macOS, Linux?
* **Cost:** Free or paid?

**Recommendation:** In this course, you can use any tools to learn Python, but I recommend the following four tools. I will only provide support for these tools. For collaboration and debugging, we will use Replit.

1. Visual Studio Code (Online, Desktop)
2. Pydroid 3 - IDE for Python 3 (Mobile App)
3. Replit (Online, Desktop, Mobile)
4. Google Colab (Online) 

**Tips:**

- Try out a few different IDEs to see which one you like best.

**Task 2: Installation Process**

- Install your chosen IDE on your device or use any online/cloud-based tools.

**Example: Installing VS Code**

**Windows:**
1. Install [Python from python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Use the Download Python button that appears first on the page to download the latest version. [Learn more ...](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial#_install-a-python-interpreter)
2. Visit the VS Code download page: [https://code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
3. Download the installer for your operating system.
4. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
5. Once installed, open VS Code.
6. Install the [Python extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)(search for "Python" in the Extensions panel).

**Task 3: Verification and Running a Python Program**

1. Open the selected IDE.
2. Write a simple Python program, such as `print("Hello, world!")`.
3. Run the code.

**Example: Visual Studio Code**

1. Open VS Code and create a new Python file (e.g., "hello.py").
2. Write a simple Python program (e.g., `print("Hello, world!")`).
3. Save the file.
4. In VS Code, verify syntax highlighting for Python code.
5. Run the program using the built-in terminal or a Python extension command.
6. Observe the output in the terminal window (e.g., "Hello, world!").
