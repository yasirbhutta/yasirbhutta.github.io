## 🎯 **What is a Taylor Diagram?**

A **Taylor Diagram** helps you visually compare **how similar multiple models or simulations are to a reference dataset** (usually real-world observations). It's widely used in science and engineering.

---

### 🔍 **3 Key Statistics it Shows**

It packs three pieces of info into one graph:

| Metric                     | What it means                                                      | How it's shown                                |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Standard Deviation (σ)** | How much the data varies/spreads                                   | **Distance from the center (origin)**         |
| **Correlation (r)**        | How well the model matches the pattern of observations             | **Angle from the x-axis**                     |
| **Centered RMSE**          | Error between model and observation (excluding average difference) | **Distance from the black dot (observation)** |

---

### 📈 **Reading the Diagram**

* The **black dot** is the **reference point** (usually the observed data).
* Each **model** is a **dot** somewhere on the diagram.
* The **closer a model's dot is to the black dot**, the better it performed.

#### For example:

* **Model A** has high correlation and standard deviation close to the observation → It’s very good!
* **Model C** has a lower correlation and too much [variability](variability-taylor-diagram.md) → Not so good.

---

### 🧠 **Why this is powerful**

Instead of looking at many charts or numbers, a Taylor diagram shows everything at once:

* Which model matches the trend?
* Which one has the right spread?
* Which one is overall closest to the truth?

---

### 🛠️ Terms in plain language:

* **Standard Deviation**: How "bouncy" the data is. Big std = wild swings.
* **Correlation**: If the model zigzags just like the real data — even if it's too high or too low.
* **RMSE**: How far off the model is overall (lower is better).

* **Model dots**: Show how each model performs.
* **Arrows**:

  * Point to **higher correlation** (model follows the shape of real data better).
  * Indicate **increasing variability** (standard deviation).
  * Remind you: **closer to the black dot (Observation)** means **better performance**.

**correlation** and **variability** work **together** to give a **complete picture** of model performance — especially in **Taylor diagrams**.

## Correlation vs Standard Deviation

### 🎯 1. **Correlation** → Pattern Similarity

* Measures **how well the model captures the shape or trend** of the observed data.
* Value ranges from **–1 (opposite)** to **+1 (perfect match)**.

> ✅ High correlation → model follows **ups and downs** of the observed data
> ❌ Low correlation → model doesn’t match the **timing or direction**

---

### 📊 2. **Standard Deviation (Variability)** → Amplitude of Fluctuations

* Measures **how much values spread out** from the mean.
* In Taylor diagrams: **radial distance** from origin = model [variability](variability-taylor-diagram.md).

> ✅ Close to observation SD → model captures **correct magnitude** of fluctuations
> ❌ Too low/high SD → model is **too flat** or **too exaggerated**

---

### 🔗 **Together in a Taylor Diagram**:

Each model is represented by a point with:

* **Angle** = correlation with observations
* **Radius** = model’s standard deviation
* **Reference point** = observed data (ideal model)

---

## ✅ Good Model:

* **High correlation** (close to 1 → angle near zero)
* **Correct variability** (distance from origin ≈ observed SD)

## ❌ Examples of Problematic Models:

| Model Type | Correlation | Variability | Problem                                 |
| ---------- | ----------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------- |
| A          | High        | Too low     | Captures pattern, but **too smooth**    |
| B          | High        | Too high    | Captures pattern, but **too jumpy**     |
| C          | Low         | Correct     | Gets magnitude, but **not timing**      |
| D          | Low         | Wrong       | **Misses both pattern and [variability](variability-taylor-diagram.md**) |

### 📍 Interpretation:

* **Black Dot**: Observation (reference) – shows the correct variability.
* **Model A (Red)**: High correlation, but low variability → too smooth.
* **Model B (Green)**: High correlation, high variability → too jumpy.
* **Model C (Blue)**: Low correlation, correct variability → wrong pattern, right spread.
* **Model D (Magenta)**: Low correlation, low variability → misses both pattern and magnitude.

---

This shows why you need to evaluate **both**:

* The **correlation** (angular position)
* The **standard deviation** (radial distance)

### 📌 Summary:

| Metric                 | Tells You                               |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Correlation**        | Does the model follow the pattern?      |
| **Standard Deviation** | Does it capture variability/magnitude?  |
| **Together**           | Does it match both shape **and** scale? |
