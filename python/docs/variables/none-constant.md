## None

In Python, `None` is a special constant that represents the absence of a value or a null value. It is an object of its own datatype, called `NoneType`. 

**Examples:**

1. **Assigning `None` to Variables**:
   ```python
   a = None
   ```

2. **Checking for `None`**:
   ```python
   if a is None:
       print("a is None")
   else:
       print("a is not None")
   ```
