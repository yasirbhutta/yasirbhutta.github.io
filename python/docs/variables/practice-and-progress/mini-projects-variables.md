## **Project: The Dynamic User Profile** üìù

This project simulates creating a simple user profile where the information can change, showcasing the flexibility of variables in Python.

---

### **Project Goal**

Create a Python script that stores user profile information (username, age, and a special status) in variables. You will then update these variables to demonstrate how their types can change (dynamic typing) and how to represent an "empty" or unassigned status using `None`.

---

### **Step-by-Step Guide**

#### **Step 1: Create the Initial Profile**

First, let's create variables to hold the user's information. This covers **variable basics**.

```python
# 1. Create a variable to store a username.
# A string is a good choice for text.
username = "CodeWizard"

# 2. Create a variable for the user's age.
# An integer is used for whole numbers.
age = 16

# 3. Create a variable for a special status.
# Let's start with it being empty.
special_status = None

# Now, print the initial profile information.
print("--- Initial User Profile ---")
print("Username:", username)
print("Age:", age)
print("Special Status:", special_status)
print("Type of 'special_status':", type(special_status))
```

**What's happening here?**
* We created three variables: `username`, `age`, and `special_status`.
* We assigned a string to `username`, an integer to `age`, and the special keyword `None` to `special_status`. `None` is used to signify the absence of a value.

---

#### **Step 2: Update the Profile (Dynamic Typing in Action)**

Now, imagine the user has earned a special badge! We will update the `special_status` variable. This demonstrates **dynamic typing**, where a variable can hold different data types.

```python
# The user just earned a "Gold" status!
# Let's update the 'special_status' variable.
print("\n--- Profile Updated! ---")

# This is where dynamic typing happens!
# The 'special_status' variable is about to change from NoneType to a string.
special_status = "Gold Member"

# The user also had a birthday. Let's update their age.
age = age + 1 # Or you can write age += 1

# Print the updated profile.
print("Username:", username)
print("Age:", age)
print("Special Status:", special_status)
print("New type of 'special_status':", type(special_status))
```

**What's happening here?**
* The `special_status` variable, which was previously `None` (type `NoneType`), now holds the string `"Gold Member"` (type `str`). Python automatically handles this change in data type. This is dynamic typing.
* We also updated the `age` by performing a basic calculation.

### **Full Code**

Here is the complete script. You can copy and paste this into a Python file (e.g., `profile.py`) and run it.

```python
# --- Step 1: Create the Initial Profile ---

# Create variables for the user profile.
username = "CodeWizard"
age = 16
special_status = None # Use None for an empty or unassigned value

# Print the initial profile information.
print("--- Initial User Profile ---")
print("Username:", username)
print("Age:", age)
print("Special Status:", special_status)
print("Type of 'special_status':", type(special_status))
print("-" * 20) # A separator line for clarity

# --- Step 2: Update the Profile (Dynamic Typing) ---

print("\n--- Profile Updated! ---")

# The 'special_status' variable changes from NoneType to a string.
special_status = "Gold Member"

# The user's age is updated.
age = age + 1

# Print the new profile details.
print("Username:", username)
print("Age:", age)
print("Special Status:", special_status)
print("New type of 'special_status':", type(special_status))
print("-" * 20)
```
