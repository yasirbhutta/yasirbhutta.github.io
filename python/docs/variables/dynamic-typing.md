[video: Is Python a Dynamic Language?](https://youtu.be/4qweH-RCfCQ)

- Python is a dynamically typed language. This means that the Python interpreter does type checking only as code runs, and the type of a variable is allowed to change over its lifetime.[1]
- In Python, variables are dynamic, meaning they can change types during the execution of a program. This flexibility allows you to assign a value of any type to a variable and later reassign it to a value of a different type without any issues. This dynamic nature of variables is due to Python being a dynamically typed language.

## What is Dynamic Typing?

**Dynamic typing** means that:
- Python determines the **type of a variable at runtime** (while the program is running)
- You don't need to declare what type a variable is when you create it
- The same variable can hold values of different types at different times

This is different from **static typing** (used in languages like Java or C++) where you must declare a variable's type when you create it, and it can't change.

## **Dynamic Typing vs. Static Typing**  

| Feature         | Python (Dynamic Typing) | Java/C++ (Static Typing) |
|----------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Type Declaration | Not required (`x = 10`) | Required (`int x = 10`) |
| Type Change     | Allowed (`x = "text"`)  | Not allowed (Compile error) |
| Flexibility    | High (Works with any type) | Strict (Fixed type) |

## **Examples of Dynamic Typing in Python** 

### **1. Variable Type Changes at Runtime**  

```python
my_var = 10       # my_var is an integer
print(type(my_var))  # Output: <class 'int'>

my_var = "Hello"  # Now my_var is a string
print(type(my_var))  # Output: <class 'str'>

my_var = 3.14     # Now it's a float
print(type(my_var))  # Output: <class 'float'>
```

Another example of variable type changes at runtime.

```python
# Initial assignment of an integer value
x = 10
print(x)  # Output: 10
print(type(x))  # Output: <class 'int'>

# Reassigning a string value to the same variable
x = "Hello, World!"
print(x)  # Output: Hello, World!
print(type(x))  # Output: <class 'str'>

# Reassigning a list to the same variable
x = [1, 2, 3]
print(x)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]
print(type(x))  # Output: <class 'list'>

# Reassigning a float value to the same variable
x = 3.14
print(x)  # Output: 3.14
print(type(x))  # Output: <class 'float'>
```

In this example:

1. `x` is initially assigned an integer value of `10`.
2. `x` is then reassigned a string value `"Hello, World!"`.
3. `x` is later reassigned a list `[1, 2, 3]`.
4. Finally, `x` is reassigned a float value `3.14`.

Each time, the type of `x` changes dynamically to match the type of the value assigned to it. This flexibility is one of the powerful features of Python, allowing for more concise and adaptable code.

### Example 2: No Type Declarations Needed
```python
# In statically typed languages you might need to do:
# int age = 25
# string name = "Alice"

# In Python, it's much simpler:
age = 25          # Python knows it's an integer
name = "Alice"    # Python knows it's a string
price = 9.99      # Python knows it's a float
```

### **2. No Need for Explicit Type Declarations**  
```python
# Python (Dynamic)
age = 25            # Automatically an int
name = "Alice"      # Automatically a str

# Java (Static)
# int age = 25;     # Must declare type
# String name = "Alice";
```

### **3. Functions Work with Multiple Types**  
```python
def multiply(x):
    return x * 2

print(multiply(5))     # 10 (int)
print(multiply("A"))   # "AA" (str)
print(multiply([1,2])) # [1, 2, 1, 2] (list)
```

## Why is Dynamic Typing Useful?

1. **More flexible code**: You can write functions that work with different types
2. **Faster prototyping**: Don't worry about types when you're experimenting
3. **Less boilerplate**: No need for type declarations everywhere

## **Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them**  

### **1. Type Errors in Operations**  
```python
a = "10"
b = 5
print(a + b)  # TypeError (can't add str + int)
```
✅ **Fix:** Explicitly convert types  
```python
print(int(a) + b)  # 15
```

### **2. Unexpected Type Changes**  
```python
count = "5"    # Meant to be int?
total = count + 10  # Error!
```
✅ **Solution:** Use `type()` checks  
```python
if isinstance(count, int):
    total = count + 10
else:
    count = int(count)
```

## **Type Checking & Type Hints in Python**  

### **1. Checking Types at Runtime**  
```python
x = 3.14
print(type(x))          # <class 'float'>
print(isinstance(x, float))  # True
```

### **2. Optional Type Hints (Python 3.5+)**  
```python
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return "Hello, " + name
```
❗ **Note:** Type hints improve readability but **don’t enforce types**.

## Summary

✔ Python variables **do not need type declarations**.  
✔ The same variable can **hold different types** (`int`, `str`, `list`, etc.).  
✔ Dynamic typing enables **flexible functions** but requires **care with type mismatches**.  
✔ Use `type()` and `isinstance()` for **runtime type checks**.  
✔ Type hints (e.g., `variable: int`) improve **code clarity** but are optional.  

Dynamic typing makes Python **easy for beginners** while remaining powerful for advanced use cases.
