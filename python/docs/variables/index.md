## **1. What Are Variables?**

- A variable is a named storage location in a computer's memory that is used to hold data or values. It allows programmers to store and manipulate data within a program.

**Purpose:** Variables provide a way to store and manage data that can be used and manipulated throughout a program. They make programs more flexible and allow for dynamic data storage.

**Assignment statement:** in Python is used to assign a value to a variable. Its primary purpose is to store and manage data within a program.

**Imagine variables as labeled boxes:**

- You have boxes for storing different things (numbers, words, etc.).
- Each box has a name (label) to identify what's inside.
- You can put things in, take them out, and change what's inside.
- 

**Example:**  
```python
name = "Alice"      # Stores text  
age = 25            # Stores a number  
is_student = True   # Stores True/False  
```

### **Assignment Operator (`=`)**  
Use `=` to assign values. No need to declare types!  

**Key Rules:**  
- **Reassignment:** Change a variable‚Äôs value anytime.  
  ```python
  x = 10  
  x = "hello"  # Now x is a string!  
  ```  
- **Multiple Assignment:**  
  ```python
  a, b = 1, 2          # a=1, b=2  
  x = y = z = 0        # All set to 0  
  ```  
- **Swapping:**  
  ```python
  x, y = 10, 20  
  x, y = y, x  # Swap! (Now x=20, y=10)  
  ```  

**Common Mistakes:**  
- Using spaces: `user name = "Bob"` ‚ùå  
- Starting with numbers: `2nd_place = "Silver"` ‚ùå

## **2. Variable Naming Rules**

In Python, valid variable names must adhere to the following rules:

- **Begin with a letter or an underscore:** The first character of a variable name must be a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).
- **Followed by letters, digits, or underscores:** After the first character, the variable name can contain letters, digits (0-9), or underscores.
- **Case-sensitive:** Variable names are case-sensitive. For example, myVariable and myvariable would be considered different variables.
- **No reserved keywords:** Variable names cannot be Python reserved keywords (e.g., if, for, while, class, etc.).
  
---

### **Valid vs. Invalid Variable Names in Python**  

#### **‚úÖ Valid Variable Names**  
- Can contain:  
  - Letters (`a-z`, `A-Z`)  
  - Digits (`0-9`) *but not as the first character*  
  - Underscores (`_`)  
- Are **case-sensitive** (`age`, `Age`, and `AGE` are different).  
- Should use `snake_case` (recommended Python style).  

**Examples:**  
```python
name = "Alice"  
user_age = 25  
_total = 100  
item2 = "book"  
```  

---

#### **‚ùå Invalid Variable Names**  
- Start with a digit.  
- Contain spaces or special symbols (`!`, `@`, `#`, etc.).  
- Match Python's **reserved keywords** (see below).  

**Examples:**  
```python
2name = "Bob"      # Error: Starts with digit  
first-name = "John" # Error: Hyphen not allowed  
user age = 30      # Error: Contains space  
```  

---

### **Reserved Keywords**  
Python has 35 reserved keywords (e.g., `if`, `for`, `while`).  

**Check All Keywords:**  
```python
import keyword  
print(keyword.kwlist)  
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Never use these as variable names!**  

### **Valid vs. Invalid Names**  
| Valid ‚úÖ          | Invalid ‚ùå         |  
|-------------------|--------------------|  
| `user_name`       | `user-name` (hyphen)|  
| `_total`          | `2nd_place` (starts with digit)|  
| `price2`          | `class` (reserved keyword)|  

---


**üí° Tip:**  
If you accidentally use a keyword, Python will raise a `SyntaxError`:  
```python
class = "Biology"  # Error: 'class' is a keyword  
```

---

### **üìù Interactive Task**  
**Which of these are valid?**  
```python
1. user_name  
2. 3rd_place  
3. return  
4. _price  
5. my-var  
```  
<details>  
<summary>üìö <i>Answer</i></summary>  
‚úÖ Valid: 1, 4  
‚ùå Invalid: 2 (starts with digit), 3 (keyword), 5 (hyphen)  
</details>  

---

### **üåü Best Practices**  
‚úî Use descriptive names (e.g., `student_count` vs. `n`).  
‚úî Stick to `snake_case` (e.g., `total_score`).  
‚úî Avoid single letters (except in loops like `for i in range(5)`).

## **3. Practical Tasks**  
### **Task 1: Rectangle Calculator**  
**Given:**  
```python
length = 10  
width = 5  
```  
**Your Task:** Calculate and print:  
1. **Area** (`length * width`)  
2. **Perimeter** (`2 * (length + width)`)  

<details>  
<summary>üí° Solution</summary>  

```python  
area = length * width  
perimeter = 2 * (length + width)  
print("Area:", area)  
print("Perimeter:", perimeter)  
```  
</details>  

---

### **Task 2: Exploring `type()` and `id()`**  
**Code:**  
```python
x = 10  
print(type(x))  # Output: <class 'int'>  
print(id(x))    # Output: Memory address  
```  

**Questions:**  
1. What happens if you set `x = "hello"` and check `type(x)`?  
2. Assign `y = 10`. Does `id(y)` match `id(x)`? Why?  

**üí° Hint:** Python reuses memory for small integers!

# 38 What is the purpose of declaring a variable in Python?
a) To reserve memory space for the variable
b) To give the variable a name
c) To initialize the variable with a value
d) All of the above
Answer: d


   
**Answer key (Mutiple Choice):**

1. B) A placeholder for storing data values
2. C) A variable is a name that refers to a value.
3. A) `10`
4. D) Variables must be declared before use.
5. B) `5`
6. B) It helps make the code more readable and maintainable.
7. B) `2 1`
8. C) `_value2`
9. B) `x = 5`
10. C) `TypeError`
    - **Explanation:** In Python, the + operator is used for both arithmetic addition and string concatenation. However, it cannot be used to add an integer and a string directly. The code provided attempts to add an integer (x = 5) to a string (y = "Hello"), which is not a valid operation and will result in a TypeError.
11. C) `2var`
    - **Explanation:** In Python, variable names must start with a letter or an underscore and cannot start with a number. Thus, my_var, _var, and var2 are valid, but 2var is not.
12. B) Variables are created when they are first assigned a value.
13. A) `5`
