# 38 What is the purpose of declaring a variable in Python?
a) To reserve memory space for the variable
b) To give the variable a name
c) To initialize the variable with a value
d) All of the above
Answer: d


   
**Answer key (Mutiple Choice):**

1. B) A placeholder for storing data values
2. C) A variable is a name that refers to a value.
3. A) `10`
4. D) Variables must be declared before use.
5. B) `5`
6. B) It helps make the code more readable and maintainable.
7. B) `2 1`
8. C) `_value2`
9. B) `x = 5`
10. C) `TypeError`
    - **Explanation:** In Python, the + operator is used for both arithmetic addition and string concatenation. However, it cannot be used to add an integer and a string directly. The code provided attempts to add an integer (x = 5) to a string (y = "Hello"), which is not a valid operation and will result in a TypeError.
11. C) `2var`
    - **Explanation:** In Python, variable names must start with a letter or an underscore and cannot start with a number. Thus, my_var, _var, and var2 are valid, but 2var is not.
12. B) Variables are created when they are first assigned a value.
13. A) `5`

2. Variables in Python are __________, meaning they can change type when assigned a new value.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Basic Variable Assignment

1. Create a variable called `name` and assign your name to it.
2. Create a variable called `age` and assign your age to it.
3. Create a variable called `city` and assign the city you live in to it.
4. Print all three variables.

### Exercise 2: Variable Reassignment

1. Create a variable called `favorite_color` and assign your favorite color to it.
2. Print the value of `favorite_color`.
3. Reassign a new color to `favorite_color`.
4. Print the new value of `favorite_color`.

### Exercise 3: Variable Operations

1. Create two variables called `a` and `b` and assign them the values 5 and 10, respectively.
2. Create a new variable called `sum` and assign it the value of `a` plus `b`.
3. Create a new variable called `difference` and assign it the value of `a` minus `b`.
4. Create a new variable called `product` and assign it the value of `a` times `b`.
5. Print the values of `sum`, `difference`, and `product`.

### Exercise 4: String Concatenation

1. Create a variable called `first_name` and assign your first name to it.
2. Create a variable called `last_name` and assign your last name to it.
3. Create a new variable called `full_name` and assign it the value of `first_name` concatenated with `last_name` (with a space in between).
4. Print the value of `full_name`.

**Example Solution:**
```python
first_name = "Alice"
last_name = "Johnson"

full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
print(full_name)
```

### Exercise 5: Input and Variables

1. Use the `input()` function to get the user's name and store it in a variable called `user_name`.
2. Use the `input()` function to get the user's age and store it in a variable called `user_age`.
3. Print a message saying "Hello [user_name], you are [user_age] years old."

**Example Solution:**
```python
user_name = input("Enter your name: ")
user_age = input("Enter your age: ")

print("Hello", user_name + ", you are", user_age, "years old.")
```

## Review Questions

**1. What is a variable in computer programming?**
**Answer:** A variable is a named storage location in a computer's memory that is used to hold data or values. It allows programmers to store and manipulate data within a program.

**2. What is the purpose of using variables in programming?**
**Answer:** Variables provide a way to store and manage data that can be used and manipulated throughout a program. They make programs more flexible and allow for dynamic data storage.

**3. What is the difference between declaring and initializing a variable?**
**Answer:** Declaring a variable involves specifying its name and data type, while initializing a variable means giving it an initial value. Initialization usually follows declaration but is not always required.

4. What is a variable in computer programming? Give examples of integer, string, float, and Boolean variables.
