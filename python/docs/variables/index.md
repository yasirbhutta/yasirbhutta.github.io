## 1. Introduction to Variables

- Storage containers for data (numbers, text, etc.).

### What is a variable

- A variable is a named storage location in a computer's memory that is used to hold data or values. It allows programmers to store and manipulate data within a program.

**Purpose:** Variables provide a way to store and manage data that can be used and manipulated throughout a program. They make programs more flexible and allow for dynamic data storage.

**Assignment statement:** in Python is used to assign a value to a variable. Its primary purpose is to store and manage data within a program.

**Imagine variables as labeled boxes:**

- You have boxes for storing different things (numbers, words, etc.).
- Each box has a name (label) to identify what's inside.
- You can put things in, take them out, and change what's inside.

### **How to Assign Values to Variables**  

In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to them using the `=` operator. Unlike some other languages, Python does not require explicit variable declaration (e.g., no `int x` needed).  

#### **Basic Assignment**  
```python
variable_name = value
```  
**Example:**  
```python
age = 25           # Integer assignment  
name = "Alice"     # String assignment  
price = 19.99      # Float assignment  
is_active = True   # Boolean assignment  
```

---

#### **Rules for Variable Assignment**  
1. **Single Assignment**  
   A variable holds one value at a time.  
   ```python
   x = 10  
   print(x)  # Output: 10  
   ```  
   Storing a name

   ```python
   name = "Muhammad Hamza"
   print(name)
   ```

   Remembering a favorite color

   ```python
   favorite_color = "blue" #stores "blue"  in variable
   print(favorite_color)
   ```

2. **Reassignment**  
   Variables can be reassigned to new values (even different types).  
   ```python
   x = 10  
   x = "hello"  # Dynamic typing: x is now a string  
   print(x)     # Output: hello  
   ```  

3. **Multiple Assignment**  
   Assign multiple variables in one line.  
   ```python
   a, b, c = 1, 2, 3  
   print(a, b, c)  # Output: 1 2 3  
   ```  

4. **Same Value to Multiple Variables**  
   ```python
   x = y = z = 0  
   print(x, y, z)  # Output: 0 0 0  
   ```  

---

#### **Unpacking Assignments**  
Python allows unpacking sequences (like lists/tuples) into variables:  
```python
colors = ["red", "green", "blue"]  
color1, color2, color3 = colors  
print(color2)  # Output: green  
```

---

#### **Swapping Variables**  
Python makes it easy to swap values without a temporary variable:  
```python
x, y = 10, 20  
x, y = y, x  # Swap  
print(x, y)  # Output: 20 10  
```

---

#### **Special Cases**  
1. **`None` Assignment**  
   Use `None` to represent "no value" or a null state.  
   ```python
   result = None  
   ```  

2. **Dynamic Typing Example**  
   ```python
   var = 42      # Integer  
   var = "42"    # Now a string  
   var = [42]    # Now a list  
   ```

---

#### **Common Mistakes to Avoid**  
‚ùå **Using reserved keywords** (e.g., `class = 5`).  
‚ùå **Starting with numbers** (e.g., `2name = "Bob"`).  
‚ùå **Case sensitivity** (e.g., `Age` and `age` are different).  

---

#### **Best Practices**  
‚úî Use descriptive names (e.g., `user_age` instead of `x`).  
‚úî Follow `snake_case` naming (e.g., `total_count`).  
‚úî Initialize variables before use to avoid `NameError`.  

---

### **Example Summary**  
```python
# Valid assignments  
counter = 0  
first_name, last_name = "John", "Doe"  
a = b = 10  

# Invalid assignments (will cause errors)  
2var = 5      # Error: Cannot start with a number  
for = "loop"  # Error: 'for' is a keyword  
```

---

## 2. Variable Naming Rules

In Python, valid variable names must adhere to the following rules:

- **Begin with a letter or an underscore:** The first character of a variable name must be a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).
- **Followed by letters, digits, or underscores:** After the first character, the variable name can contain letters, digits (0-9), or underscores.
- **Case-sensitive:** Variable names are case-sensitive. For example, myVariable and myvariable would be considered different variables.
- **No reserved keywords:** Variable names cannot be Python reserved keywords (e.g., if, for, while, class, etc.).
s
### **Valid vs. Invalid Variable Name**  

#### **‚úÖ Valid Variable Names**  
- Can contain:  
  - Letters (`a-z`, `A-Z`)  
  - Digits (`0-9`) *but not as the first character*  
  - Underscores (`_`)  
- Are **case-sensitive** (`age`, `Age`, and `AGE` are different).  
- Should use `snake_case` (recommended Python style).  

**Examples:**  
```python
name = "Alice"  
user_age = 25  
_total = 100  
item2 = "book"  
```  

---

#### **‚ùå Invalid Variable Names**  
- Start with a digit.  
- Contain spaces or special symbols (`!`, `@`, `#`, etc.).  
- Match Python's **reserved keywords** (see below).  

**Examples:**  
```python
2name = "Bob"      # Error: Starts with digit  
first-name = "John" # Error: Hyphen not allowed  
user age = 30      # Error: Contains space  
```

### **üö´ Python Reserved Keywords (35 Total)**  
These words have special meanings in Python and **cannot** be used as variable names:  

|          |          |          |          |  
|----------|----------|----------|----------|  
| `False`  | `None`   | `True`   | `and`    |  
| `as`     | `assert` | `async`  | `await`  |  
| `break`  | `class`  | `continue`| `def`   |  
| `del`    | `elif`   | `else`   | `except` |  
| `finally`| `for`    | `from`   | `global` |  
| `if`     | `import` | `in`     | `is`     |  
| `lambda` | `nonlocal`| `not`   | `or`     |  
| `pass`   | `raise`  | `return` | `try`    |  
| `while`  | `with`   | `yield`  |          |  

**üí° Tip:**  
If you accidentally use a keyword, Python will raise a `SyntaxError`:  
```python
class = "Biology"  # Error: 'class' is a keyword  
```

---

### **üîç How to Check Keywords**  
Run this in Python to see all reserved keywords:  
```python
import keyword
print(keyword.kwlist)
```

---

### **üìù Interactive Task**  
**Which of these are valid?**  
```python
1. user_name  
2. 3rd_place  
3. return  
4. _price  
5. my-var  
```  
<details>  
<summary>üìö <i>Answer</i></summary>  
‚úÖ Valid: 1, 4  
‚ùå Invalid: 2 (starts with digit), 3 (keyword), 5 (hyphen)  
</details>  

---

### **üåü Best Practices**  
‚úî Use descriptive names (e.g., `student_count` vs. `n`).  
‚úî Stick to `snake_case` (e.g., `total_score`).  
‚úî Avoid single letters (except in loops like `for i in range(5)`).  

---

### **‚ö° Debug Challenge**  
Fix the invalid names in this code:  
```python
1st_place = "Gold"  
for = 42  
last-name = "Smith"  
```  
<details>  
<summary>üõ†Ô∏è <i>Solution</i></summary>  
```python  
first_place = "Gold"  # No leading digit  
user_for = 42         # Avoid keyword  
last_name = "Smith"   # Hyphen ‚Üí underscore  
```  
</details>

**Example 8:** [Python Variable Names: Case-Sensitive? Avoid This Coding Mistake!](https://youtu.be/hEoVi5hZHVg)

**Key Points:**

- **[Choose meaningful names](https://youtube.com/shorts/lQy1Le8fnRs?si=kU0YflJx7lLzp_TT):** Use names that describe what the variable stores (e.g., pizza_slices instead of x).
  - [video: Meaningful Variable Names \| Python Best Practices](https://youtube.com/shorts/lQy1Le8fnRs?si=kU0YflJx7lLzp_TT)
- **Assign values using =:** The equals sign is used to put a value into a variable.
- **Change values:** You can update a variable's value later in your code.
- **Use variables in calculations and operations:** Variables can be used just like regular numbers or text in expressions.
- **Think of variables as placeholders:** They hold information that can change as your program runs.

Here‚Äôs a structured **task** based on your example, designed to reinforce variable assignment and arithmetic operations in Python:

---

## **üìù Python Variables Task: Calculate Area & Perimeter**  

### **üîπ Given Code (Starter Example)**  
```python
length = 10
width = 5

# Calculate the area
area = length * width
print("Area:", area)
```

### **üìå Task : Extend the Program**  
Modify the code to **also calculate and print** the following:  
1. **Perimeter** of the rectangle (`2 * (length + width)`).  
2. **Difference** between the length and width (`length - width`).  

**Expected Output:**  
```
Area: 50  
Perimeter: 30  
Difference: 5
```

---

Here‚Äôs a structured **task** based on your example to help learners understand `type()` and `id()` functions in Python, along with variable behavior:

---

## **üìù Python Task: Exploring `type()` and `id()`**  

#### **üîπ Given Code**  
```python
x = 10
print(type(x))   # Output: <class 'int'>
print(id(x))     # Output: Memory address (e.g., 140708539693752)
```

---

### **üìå Task 1: Predict the Output**  
Run the code above and answer:  
1. What does `type(x)` return? Why?  
2. What does `id(x)` represent? Is it the same if you run it multiple times?  

**üí° Hint:**  
- `type()` shows the **data type** of `x`.  
- `id()` returns the **memory address** where `x` is stored.  

---

### **üîç Task 2: Experiment with Different Types**  
Modify the code to check `type()` and `id()` for:  
1. A string (e.g., `x = "hello"`).  
2. A float (e.g., `x = 3.14`).  
3. A list (e.g., `x = [1, 2, 3]`).  

**Expected Output Structure:**  
```python
x = "hello"
print(type(x))  # Output: <class 'str'>
print(id(x))    # Output: (memory address)
```

---

### **‚ö° Task 3: Memory Address Investigation**  
1. Assign `y = 10` (same value as `x`).  
2. Compare `id(x)` and `id(y)`. Are they the same? Why?  
3. Now set `y = 20` and check `id(y)` again. Did it change?  

**Key Question:**  
- *Why might Python reuse memory addresses for certain values?*  
  *(Hint: Research **integer caching** in Python!)*

# Using an undefined variable 

```python
name = "Ahmad"
print(f"Hello, {lastname}")  # lastname not defined

# 38 What is the purpose of declaring a variable in Python?
a) To reserve memory space for the variable
b) To give the variable a name
c) To initialize the variable with a value
d) All of the above
Answer: d


   
**Answer key (Mutiple Choice):**

1. B) A placeholder for storing data values
2. C) A variable is a name that refers to a value.
3. A) `10`
4. D) Variables must be declared before use.

9. B) `x = 5`
10. C) `TypeError`
    - **Explanation:** In Python, the + operator is used for both arithmetic addition and string concatenation. However, it cannot be used to add an integer and a string directly. The code provided attempts to add an integer (x = 5) to a string (y = "Hello"), which is not a valid operation and will result in a TypeError.
11. C) `2var`
    - **Explanation:** In Python, variable names must start with a letter or an underscore and cannot start with a number. Thus, my_var, _var, and var2 are valid, but 2var is not.
12. B) Variables are created when they are first assigned a value.
13. A) `5`
