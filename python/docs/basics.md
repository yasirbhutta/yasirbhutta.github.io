## What is Python

- Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language.
- It is known for its clear syntax, readability, and versatility.
- Python is widely used for `web development`, `data science`, `machine learning`, and `automation`.

## Getting Started

- Install Python: Download and install it from <https://www.python.org/downloads/>.
- Choose a text editor: A program to write code, like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial), [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install), `PyCharm`, or even a simple text editor like `Notepad`.
- Text editor for Android: [Pydroid 3 - IDE for Python 3](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.iiec.pydroid3)
  - [Video: How to: Install Jupyter Notebook on an Android device](https://youtu.be/b2XNfD3xEwY?si=JFQsMiVj5xqkTgGv)
- Interactive mode: Experiment with Python directly in your terminal or command prompt using the python command.

> **Important:** Python source code files always use the `.py` extension.

## Lesson 1: Python `print` Function

### Objectives
- Understand the basic usage of the `print` function.
- Learn how to print different data types.
- Explore advanced `print` function features like formatting and special characters.
- Practice printing in various tasks.

### Introduction to `print`

The `print` function is used to output text or variables to the console. or to a file.

[Video: Use of print() function in python](https://youtu.be/RSSSyqw79_M)

**Syntax:**

```python
print(value1, value2, ..., sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)
```

**Parameters:**
- `value1, value2, ...`: The values to be printed. Multiple values can be separated by commas.
- `sep`: (Optional) Specifies how to separate multiple values. Default is a space `' '`.
- `end`: (Optional) Specifies what to print at the end. Default is a newline character `'\n'`.
- `file`: (Optional) Specifies the file where to print. Default is `sys.stdout` (console).
- `flush`: (Optional) Specifies whether to forcibly flush the stream. Default is `False`.

### Task 1: Basic Printing

**Instructions:**
1. Print a simple message.
2. Print multiple items separated by commas.

**Examples**
```python
# Task 1.1: Print a simple message
print("Hello, world!")

# Task 1.2: Print multiple items
print("Hello", "world", 2024)
```

## Task 2: Printing Different Data Types

### Instructions
1. Print integers, floats, and strings.

### Examples

```python
# Task 2.1: Print different data types
print(42)
print(3.14159)
print("This is a string")

```

## Task 3: Using `sep` and `end` Parameters

### Instructions
1. Change the separator between printed items.
2. Change the ending character of a print statement.

### Examples
```python
# Task 3.1: Change the separator
print("apple", "banana", "cherry", sep=", ")

# Task 3.2: Change the ending character
print("Hello", end=" ")
print("world!")

# Task 3.3: Print with a custom ending character:
print("Hello", "World", end="!")

```

## Task 4: Print Variables

### Instructions
- print variables values using print function

```python

# Task 4.1: print a integer variable
x = 5
print(x)

# Task 4.2: print a string variable
message = 'Python is fun'

# print the string message
print(message)

# Task 4.3: print a string variable
message = "How are you?"
print(message)

```
## Task 5: String Formatting

### Instructions
1. Use f-strings (formatted string literals) for the same purpose.

### Examples
```python
# Task 5.1: Use f-strings
name = "Ahmad"
age = 30
print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")
```

## Task 6: Printing Special Characters

### Instructions
1. Print a newline character within a string.
2. Print a tab character within a string.

### Examples
```python
# Task 6.1: Print a newline character
print("Hello\nWorld")

# Task 6.2: Print a tab character
print("Hello\tWorld")
```

```python
# Task 6.3: Print a tab character

print("Name\tAge\tCity")
print("Alice\t30\tNew York")
print("Bob\t25\tLos Angeles")
```

Output:
```
Name    Age    City
Alice   30     New York
Bob     25     Los Angeles
```
In this example, `\t` is used to align the columns of text.

In Python, the `\t` character is a special escape sequence that represents a horizontal tab. When used in the `print` function or any other string operation, it inserts a tab space in the output. This can be particularly useful for formatting text to make it more readable.

 `\t` can be combined with other string manipulation techniques, such as f-strings

```python

# Task 6.4: Print a tab character with f-strings

name = "Alice"
age = 30
city = "New York"

print(f"{name}\t{age}\t{city}")
```

## Task 7: Printing to a File

### Instructions
1. Print a message to a text file instead of the console.

### Examples
```python
# Task 7.1: Print to a file
with open("output.txt", "w") as file:
    print("Hello, file!", file=file)
```
When you use the instruction with open("output.txt", "w") as file in Python, the file is created in the current working directory of your program. On an Android system, this could be different depending on the environment where the code is executed (e.g., a specific app's data directory, a shared storage location, etc.). 

To determine the exact path, you can use the os module to get the current working directory:

```python
import os

print(os.getcwd())
```

Regarding file closure, when you use the `with` statement to open a file, Python automatically takes care of closing the file for you once the block of code under the `with` statement is executed. There is no need to explicitly close the file; it is done automatically when the block is exited. This is one of the benefits of using the with statement for fileÂ operations.

### Practice Exercises

#### Exercise 1: Print Your Favorite Quote
Print your favorite quote, ensuring proper formatting.

#### Exercise 2: Create a Simple Receipt
Print a simple receipt with items and prices, properly aligned using tab characters.

#### Exercise 3: Use Variables in Print Statements
Create variables for your name, age, and favorite hobby, then print a sentence using these variables.

#### Exercise 4: Output to a File
Write a program that prints a summary of your week (e.g., tasks completed, hours worked) to a text file.

#### Exercise 5: 100 times "hello world" without loop

## Comments

- Comments are important for making code more readable and understandable, especially for other programmers who may need to read or modify the code.
- Comments in Python are non-executable lines of code and ignored by the Python interpreter when the code is executed. 

There are two main types of comments in Python:

- **Single-line comments:** These comments start with the hash symbol (#) and extend to the end of the line.

```python
# This is a single-line comment
print("Hello, World!")
```

- **Multi-line comments:** These comments are enclosed in triple quotes (""" or ''').

```python
"""
This is a multi-line comment.
It can span multiple lines of code.
"""
print("Hello, World!")
```

## Indentation

Indentation is a very important concept in Python. It refers to adding white space before a statement to a particular block of code. In another word, all the statements with the same space to the right, belong to the same code block.

For example, consider the following code snippet:

```python
if True:
    print("True")
else:
    print("False")
```
