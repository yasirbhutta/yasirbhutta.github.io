## nominal column

A nominal column in a dataset contains categorical data without any intrinsic ordering or ranking. Examples of nominal columns include:

- **Customer ID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Product Category**: Labels for different product types, such as "Electronics," "Clothing," or "Groceries."
- **Region**: Geographic areas like "North," "South," "East," and "West."
- **Payment Method**: Types of payment used, like "Credit Card," "Cash," or "Online Payment".

These columns are useful for grouping and segmenting data but do not imply any order or scale among the categories.

When we say a nominal column has "no intrinsic ordering or ranking," it means the categories in that column do not follow any natural sequence or hierarchy. The values are simply labels or names and are not meant to be compared in terms of order or value.

For example, if a column called **"Fruit Type"** contains categories like "Apple," "Banana," and "Cherry," thereâ€™s no inherent reason to rank them as better or worse, or in any particular sequence. These values are just distinct types of fruit, with no relationship that makes one fruit "higher" or "lower" than another. 

In contrast, columns with an order, like "Low," "Medium," "High," or numbers that represent quantities, have an inherent progression or ranking.
