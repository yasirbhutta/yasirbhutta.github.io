## Radian
A radian is a unit of angular measure used in mathematics, particularly in trigonometry and calculus. It's based on the radius of a circle. One radian is the angle created when the length of an arc on a circle is equal to the circle's radius.

**Key Facts about Radians:**

- In a full circle (360 degrees), there are \( 2\pi \) radians.
- Therefore, 1 radian â‰ˆ 57.3 degrees.
- Radians are often used in mathematical functions and calculus because they simplify many formulas, especially in trigonometry, where angles measured in radians lead to cleaner equations.
