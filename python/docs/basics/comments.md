## Comments

- Comments are important for making code more readable and understandable, especially for other programmers who may need to read or modify the code.
- Comments in Python are non-executable lines of code and ignored by the Python interpreter when the code is executed. 

There are two main types of comments in Python:

- **Single-line comments:** These comments start with the hash symbol (#) and extend to the end of the line.

```python
# This is a single-line comment
print("Hello, World!")
```

- **Multi-line comments:** These comments are enclosed in triple quotes (""" or ''').

```python
"""
This is a multi-line comment.
It can span multiple lines of code.
"""
print("Hello, World!")
```
