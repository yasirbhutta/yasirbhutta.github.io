### Mini Project: Build a Simple Expense Tracker

**Objective:**  
Create a Python program that allows users to track their daily expenses. This project will test your understanding of Python basics, including variables, `print` statements, string formatting, and file handling.

---

#### **Project Requirements:**

1. **Input Expenses:**
   - Prompt the user to enter the name of an expense (e.g., "Groceries") and its cost.
   - Allow the user to enter multiple expenses.

2. **Display Expenses:**
   - Print a neatly formatted list of all expenses using the `print` function.
   - Use `\t` (tab character) to align the expense names and their costs.

3. **Calculate Total:**
   - Calculate and display the total cost of all expenses.

4. **Save to File:**
   - Save the list of expenses and the total cost to a text file named `expenses.txt`.

5. **Error Handling:**
   - Handle invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric values for costs) gracefully.

---

#### **Example Output:**

```output
Welcome to the Expense Tracker!

Enter the name of the expense (or type 'done' to finish): Groceries Enter the cost of Groceries: 50

Enter the name of the expense (or type 'done' to finish): Rent Enter the cost of Rent: 500

Enter the name of the expense (or type 'done' to finish): Utilities Enter the cost of Utilities: 100

Enter the name of the expense (or type 'done' to finish): done

Here is your expense summary: Expense Name Cost
Groceries $50 Rent $500 Utilities $100
Total: $650

Your expenses have been saved to 'expenses.txt'.
```

#### **Steps to Complete the Project:**

1. **Plan the Program:**
   - Identify the variables needed (e.g., `expenses`, `total_cost`).
   - Decide on the structure of the program (e.g., input loop, calculations, output).

2. **Write the Code:**
   - Use a loop to collect expense data from the user.
   - Store the expenses in a list or dictionary.
   - Use string formatting to display the expenses neatly.
   - Write the data to a file using the `with open()` statement.

3. **Test the Program:**
   - Test with different inputs, including invalid ones (e.g., entering text instead of numbers for costs).
   - Verify that the output is correct and the file is saved properly.

---

#### **Coding Challenge:**
- Add a feature to categorize expenses (e.g., "Food", "Rent", "Utilities").
- Allow the user to view expenses from a previous session by reading from the `expenses.txt` file.
- Add a date and time stamp to each expense entry using the `datetime` module.

---

#### **Learning Outcomes:**
- Practice using variables, loops, and conditionals.
- Learn how to format output using `print` and escape characters.
- Understand basic file handling in Python.
- Develop problem-solving and debugging skills.
