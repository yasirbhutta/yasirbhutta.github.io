## Table of Contents

1. [break Statement](#1-break)
2. [continue Statement](#2-continue)
3. [pass Statement](#3-pass)
4. [Tasks](#4-tasks)

These statements modify the behavior of loops.

**break:** Terminates the loop entirely.
**continue:** Skips the current iteration and moves to the next one.
**pass:** Does nothing, often used as a placeholder.

## 1. `break`

Exits the loop prematurely.

```python
for item in sequence:
    if some_condition:
        break  # exit the loop
```

 ### Example 1: Using Break Statement in a Loop with Range

```python
for x in range(3):
    if x == 1:
        break
    print(x)
```
### Example 2: Exit a loop when a number is found
```python
# Search for the number 5 and exit the loop when found
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

for num in numbers:
    print(f"Checking {num}...")
    if num == 5:
        print("Number 5 found! Exiting the loop.")
        break  # Exit the loop
```

**Output**:
```
Checking 1...
Checking 2...
Checking 3...
Checking 4...
Checking 5...
Number 5 found! Exiting the loop.
```

### **ðŸ“º Python Tutorial in Urdu: Using Python break statement with a while loop**  

{% assign video_type = "video" %}
{% assign video_id = "v=KWuyQ7HQUBE" %}
{% include youtube-video.html video_type=video_type video_id=video_id %}


### Example 3: Password validation with `while` loop
```python
# Keep asking for a password until the correct one is entered
correct_password = "python123"

while True:
    user_input = input("Enter the password: ")
    if user_input == correct_password:
        print("Access granted!")
        break  # Exit the loop
    else:
        print("Wrong password. Try again!")
```

### Example 4: **Temperature Monitoring**  
Stop monitoring if temperature exceeds a safe limit.
```python
temperatures = [25, 30, 32, 28, 45, 29, 33]  # Sensor readings

for temp in temperatures:
    if temp > 40:
        print(f"ALERT: Temperature {temp}Â°C is unsafe! Shutting down.")
        break  # Exit immediately
    print(f"Temperature {temp}Â°C is safe.")
```

**Output**:
```
Temperature 25Â°C is safe.
Temperature 30Â°C is safe.
Temperature 32Â°C is safe.
Temperature 28Â°C is safe.
ALERT: Temperature 45Â°C is unsafe! Shutting down.
```

## 2. `continue`

Skips the current iteration and proceeds to the next iteration of the loop.

```python
for item in sequence:
    if some_condition:
        continue  # skip the rest of the code in this iteration
    # code to execute if some_condition is False
```

### **ðŸ“º Video Tutorial: How to Effectively Use Break and Continue Statements**  

{% assign video_type = "video" %}
{% assign video_id = "v=LfF9CsyVRgU" %}
{% include youtube-video.html video_type=video_type video_id=video_id %}
 
### Example 5: Skip even numbers using `continue` Statement

Skips the **current iteration** and moves to the next loop cycle.

```python
# Print only odd numbers (skip even numbers)
for num in range(1, 11):
    if num % 2 == 0:
        continue  # Skip even numbers
    print(num)
```

**Output**:
```
1
3
5
7
9
```

### Example 6: **Data Cleaning using `continue` Statement**  
Skip invalid entries when processing a dataset.
```python
user_ages = [20, 15, "unknown", 30, -5, 25]  # Some invalid data

print("Valid ages:")
for age in user_ages:
    if not isinstance(age, int) or age < 0 or age > 120:
        continue  # Skip invalid entries
    print(f"- {age} years old")
```

**Output**:
```
Valid ages:
- 20 years old
- 15 years old
- 30 years old
- 25 years old
```

## 3. `pass`

A null statement, used as a placeholder.

```python
if condition:
    pass  # do nothing
```

## 4. Tasks

### **Task 1: Coffee Machine Stock Check using `break` Statement**  
   Simulate a coffee machine that stops serving when a drink is out of stock.  
   - **Input List**: `["latte", "cappuccino", "espresso", "mocha", "out_of_stock", "latte"]`  
   - **Goal**: Loop through the list and stop when "out_of_stock" is found.  
   - **Example Output**:  
     ```
     Serving latte...  
     Serving cappuccino...  
     Serving espresso...  
     Serving mocha...  
     Out of stock! Machine stopping.  
     ```
     
### **Task 2: Skip Negative Numbers**  
   Calculate the sum of positive numbers in a list, ignoring negatives.  
   - **Input**: `[5, -2, 10, -8, 3]`  
   - **Goal**: Use `continue` to skip negative values.  
   - **Output**: `Sum of positive numbers: 18`

### **Task 3: Simple Calculator with Exit using `continue` and `break`**  
   Create a loop that:  
   - Lets users type numbers to add.  
   - Skips non-numeric inputs (use `continue`).  
   - Exits when the user types "quit" (use `break`).  
   - **Example Output**:  
     ```
     Enter a number (or 'quit'): 5  
     Enter a number (or 'quit'): ten  
     Invalid input!  
     Enter a number (or 'quit'): 3  
     Enter a number (or 'quit'): quit  
     Total: 8  
     ```

### **Task 4: Movie Ticket Checker**  
   Loop through a list of ages and:  
   - Skip ages < 0 (invalid).  
   - Stop if a "VIP" (age 100+) is found.  
   - **Input**: `[25, -5, 30, 105, 40]`  
   - **Output**:  
     ```
     Valid age: 25  
     Skipped invalid age.  
     Valid age: 30  
     VIP detected! Stopping sales.  
     ```

### **Task 5: Flight Booking System**  
   Check seat availability in a list. Stop when a seat is found, or skip "reserved" seats.  
   - **Input**: `["reserved", "reserved", "available", "reserved"]`  
   - **Output**:  
     ```
     Seat 1: Reserved.  
     Seat 2: Reserved.  
     Seat 3: Available! Booked successfully.  
     ```
