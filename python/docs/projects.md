## Project 4: Network Intrusion Detection System 

- **Project Name:** Network Intrusion Detection System using Machine Learning
- **Domain:** Computer Networks / Cybersecurity / Machine Learning
- **Objective:** The objective of this project is to build a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) that uses machine learning to detect and classify network intrusions. This system can help in identifying malicious activities in network traffic by analyzing patterns and behaviors. By using a dataset containing both normal and abnormal network traffic, we aim to develop a model that can classify traffic as either benign or malicious.
