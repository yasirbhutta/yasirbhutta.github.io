Flow control statements in Python determine the order in which your code is executed. They allow you to make decisions, repeat actions, and control the program's flow based on specific conditions.

**Python has three types of control structures:**

1. Sequential: Default mode
2. Selection: Used for decisions and branching
3. Repetition: Used for looping, i.e., repeating a code multiple times.

for more details, see [Understanding Control Structures in Python](../posts/control-structures-python.md)

- 5.3 Looping Statements (for, while)
  - There are two ways to create loops in Python: with the for-loop and the while-loop.
  - Repeat actions using `for` and `while` loops.
