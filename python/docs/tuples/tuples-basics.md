## Tuple in Python

- In python, a tuple is an [immutable](../data-types/immutable-mutable.md) sequence of elements. it is similar to a list, but the elements of a tuple cannot be modified once they are created.
- Tuple is a collection data type in python. It is useful for storing multiple related values as a single unit.
- Sequence types in python - list, tuple and range

## Basic Operations

### 1. Creating Tuples

**A tuple is created by enclosing elements within parentheses () and separating them with commas.** While parentheses are technically optional, it's generally considered best practice to use them for clarity and consistency.

## Example 1

Some common ways to create tuples in Python include:

```python
tup = (1,2,3)
print(tup) # Output: (1, 2, 3)
# check the type of variable
print(type(tup)) # Output: <class 'tuple'>

# another example to create tuple
tup1 = 4,5,6
print(tup1) # Output: (4, 5, 6)

# tuple with mixed datatypes
tup_mixed = (7, "String", 7.8)
print(tup_mixed)

```

## **üì∫ Python Tutorial: Learn 5 Easy Ways to Create Tuples in Python**  
This video explains how to create tuples in Python.

{% assign video_type = "video" %}
{% assign video_id = "QpRiHuQycXg" %}
{% include youtube-video.html video_type=video_type video_id=video_id %}

### 2. Conversion
```python
# List to tuple
list_data = [1, 2, 3]
tuple_data = tuple(list_data)  # (1, 2, 3)

# String to tuple
str_data = "hello"
tuple_chars = tuple(str_data)  # ('h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o')
```

A **nested tuple** is a tuple that contains one or more tuples as element.

**Empty and single item tuple:**

- A special problem is the construction of tuples containing 0 or 1 item.
- Empty tuples are constructed by an empty pair of parentheses
- A tuple with one item is constructed by following a value with a comma (it is not sufficient to enclose a single value in parentheses).

- [Python tuples example : How to create an Empty tuple and Single value tuple](../../videos/tuples-empty-single-value.md)

### 2. Accessing Elements

```python
my_tuple = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')

# Indexing
print(my_tuple[0])    # 'a' (first element)
print(my_tuple[-1])   # 'e' (last element)

# Slicing
print(my_tuple[1:3])  # ('b', 'c')
print(my_tuple[:2])   # ('a', 'b')
print(my_tuple[2:])   # ('c', 'd', 'e')
print(my_tuple[::-1]) # ('e', 'd', 'c', 'b', 'a') (reverse)
```

### Python tuple example 2: How to Access Tuple Items in Python

{% assign video_type = "video" %}
{% assign video_id = "6dZUdvI8V_Q" %}
{% include youtube-video.html video_type=video_type video_id=video_id %}

## Tuple Operations

### 3. Concatenation (+)
```python
tuple1 = (1, 2, 3)
tuple2 = (4, 5)
combined = tuple1 + tuple2  # (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
```

### 4. Repetition (*)
```python
repeated = ('hi',) * 3  # ('hi', 'hi', 'hi')
```

### 5. Membership Testing
```python
colors = ('red', 'green', 'blue')
print('green' in colors)    # True
print('yellow' not in colors)  # True
```

### 6. Iteration
```python
for item in ('a', 'b', 'c'):
    print(item)
```

### 7. Unpacking tuples
**Tuple unpacking allows you to assign the values of a tuple to multiple variables in a single step.** Each element of the tuple is assigned to a corresponding variable.

```python
point = (10, 20)
x, y = point  # x=10, y=20

# Extended unpacking
values = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
a, b, *rest = values  # a=1, b=2, rest=[3, 4, 5]
```

### Python tuple example 4: Unpacking a Tuple in Python

{% assign video_type = "video" %}
{% assign video_id = "fi-nvcQukRc" %}
{% include youtube-video.html video_type=video_type video_id=video_id %}


- The number of variables on the left side must match the number of elements in the tuple, or you‚Äôll get a `ValueError`.
  
```python
# Correct unpacking - number of variables matches tuple elements
point = (3, 5)
x, y = point
print(f"x: {x}, y: {y}")  # Output: x: 3, y: 5

# Incorrect unpacking - will raise ValueError
colors = ('red', 'green', 'blue')
# color1, color2 = colors  # This would raise ValueError
# Correct way would be:
color1, color2, color3 = colors
print(color1, color2, color3)  # Output: red green blue
```

**Tuples are [immutable](../data-types/immutable-mutable.md)**, meaning once created, their elements cannot be changed, added, or removed. However, **they can store mutable objects** (like lists or dictionaries), which *can* be modified.

for more details, see [Immutable vs. Mutable](../data-types/immutable-mutable.md)

### Example:
```python
my_tuple = (1, 2, [3, 4])  # Tuple with an immutable list inside

# my_tuple[0] = 10  ‚ùå Fails (can't modify tuple)
my_tuple[2].append(5)      # ‚úÖ Works (modifying the inner list)

print(my_tuple)  # Output: (1, 2, [3, 4, 5])
```

## Tasks

### **Task 1: Creating a Tuple**  
Write a Python program that:  
- Creates a tuple with **three** different items (e.g., a number, a word, and a decimal).  
- Prints the **entire tuple**.  
- Prints the **first item** in the tuple.  

**Example Output:**  
```
Tuple: (10, 'Apple', 3.5)
First item: 10
```

### **Task 2: Tuple Unpacking**  
Write a Python program that:  
- Creates a tuple with three values: name, age, and country.  
- Uses **tuple unpacking** to assign each value to separate variables.  
- Prints the extracted values.  

**Example Output:**  
```
Name: Alice
Age: 25
Country: USA
```

---

### **Task 3: Accessing Tuple Elements**  
Write a Python program that:  
- Creates a tuple with **five numbers**.  
- Prints the **last number** using negative indexing.  

**Example Output:**  
```
Numbers: (5, 10, 15, 20, 25)
Last number: 25
```
### Task 4: Calculate the Sum of a Tuple Using a For Loop
Write a Python function called `sum_tuple` that takes one argument: a tuple of numbers. The function should return the sum of all the numbers in the tuple using a `for` loop (not the built-in `sum()` function).

**Input:**

A tuple containing numerical values (integers or floats).
Example:

```python
(1, 2, 3, 4)
```

**Expected Output:**

A single numerical value representing the sum of the numbers in the tuple.
For the input above, the output would be:

```python
10
```

### Task 5: Printing Tuple Elements with a While Loop
Write a Python function called `print_tuple_while` that takes a tuple of strings as input. This function should iterate through the tuple using a `while` loop and print each element of the tuple on a separate line.

**Input:**

A tuple of strings, for example:
```python
my_tuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
```

**Expected Output:**

```
apple
banana
cherry
```

**Here's a starting point for the function:**

```python
def print_tuple_while(input_tuple):
    index = 0
    # Complete the while loop to print each element
    # of the input_tuple
    pass

# Example usage:
my_tuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print_tuple_while(my_tuple)
```

### Task 6: How to Swap Variables in One Line of Code using Tuple Unpacking

Write a Python function called `swap_variables` that takes two variables, `a` and `b`, as input. The function should swap the values of these two variables using the one-line tuple unpacking technique and then return the new values of `a` and `b` as a tuple.

**Input:**

Two variables of any data type. For example:
```python
x = 10
y = 5
```

**Expected Output:**

A tuple containing the swapped values. For the example input above:
```
(5, 10)
```

**Here's a starting point for the function:**

```python
def swap_variables(a, b):
    # Write your one-line swap using tuple unpacking here
    return a, b

# Example usage:
x = 10
y = 5
swapped_x, swapped_y = swap_variables(x, y)
print(f"Original x: {x}, y: {y}")
print(f"Swapped x: {swapped_x}, y: {swapped_y}")
```
