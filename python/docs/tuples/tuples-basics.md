### 3.4.1 Tuple in Python

- In python, a tuple is an immutable sequence of elements. it is similar to a list, but the elements of a tuple cannot be modified once they are created.
- Tuple is a collection data type in python. It is useful for storing multiple related values as a single unit.
- Sequence types in python - list, tuple and range

**Creating a Tuple in Python**

**A tuple is created by enclosing elements within parentheses () and separating them with commas.** While parentheses are technically optional, it's generally considered best practice to use them for clarity and consistency.

**Python Tutorial:How to create a tuple in Python**

{% assign video_type = "video" %}
{% assign video_id = "QpRiHuQycXg" %}

{% include youtube-video.html video_type=video_type video_id=video_id %}


**Example**

Some common ways to create tuples in Python include:

```python
tup = (1,2,3)
print(tup) # Output: (1, 2, 3)
# check the type of variable
print(type(tup)) # Output: <class 'tuple'>

# another example to create tuple
tup1 = 4,5,6
print(tup1) # Output: (4, 5, 6)

# tuple with mixed datatypes
tup_mixed = (7, "String", 7.8)
print(tup_mixed)

tup4 = tuple('string')
print(tup4) # Output: ('s','t','r','i','n','g')

```

A nested tuple is a tuple that contains one or more tuples as element.

## Empty and single item tuple

- A special problem is the construction of tuples containing 0 or 1 item.
- Empty tuples are constructed by an empty pair of parentheses
- A tuple with one item is constructed by following a value with a comma (it is not sufficient to enclose a single value in parentheses.

## Accessing the elements of Tuple

## Unpacking tuples

**Tuple unpacking allows you to assign the values of a tuple to multiple variables in a single step.** Each element of the tuple is assigned to a corresponding variable.

- [Example #1: Unpacking a Tuple in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fi-nvcQukRc&list=PLKYRx0Ibk7Vi-CC7ik98qT0VKK0F7ikja&index=105)
- [Example #2: How to Swap Variables in One Line of Code using Tuple Unpacking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCeTYJVktmU&list=PLKYRx0Ibk7Vi-CC7ik98qT0VKK0F7ikja&index=45)

**Example:**

```python
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
a, b, c = my_tuple

print(a)  # Output: 1
print(b)  # Output: 2
print(c)  # Output: 3
```

- The number of variables on the left side must match the number of elements in the tuple, or youâ€™ll get a `ValueError`.
  
## Example #2

```python
# Tuples are immutable
# but they can contain mutable objects
```



### **Task 6: Creating a Tuple**  
Write a Python program that:  
- Creates a tuple with **three** different items (e.g., a number, a word, and a decimal).  
- Prints the **entire tuple**.  
- Prints the **first item** in the tuple.  

**Example Output:**  
```
Tuple: (10, 'Apple', 3.5)
First item: 10
```

### **Task 7: Tuple Unpacking**  
Write a Python program that:  
- Creates a tuple with three values: name, age, and country.  
- Uses **tuple unpacking** to assign each value to separate variables.  
- Prints the extracted values.  

**Example Output:**  
```
Name: Alice
Age: 25
Country: USA
```

### **Task 8: Accessing Tuple Elements**  
Write a Python program that:  
- Creates a tuple with **five numbers**.  
- Prints the **last number** using negative indexing.  

**Example Output:**  
```
Numbers: (5, 10, 15, 20, 25)
Last number: 25
```
