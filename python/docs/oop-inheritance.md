## üî∑ What is Inheritance?

**Inheritance** is a way to create a new class from an existing class.  
It helps us **reuse code**, **extend functionality**, and follow the **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principle.

### ‚úÖ Key Points:
- The **base class** (or parent class) contains common features.
- The **derived class** (or child class) inherits from the base class and can:
  - Use parent‚Äôs methods and attributes
  - Add its own attributes and methods
  - Modify (override) methods from the parent class.

Think of inheritance like a family tree. A child inherits traits (methods and attributes) from their parents, but they can also have their own unique traits.

## Single Inheritance

**Single Inheritance** is a type of inheritance where a child class inherits from only one parent class. This allows the child class to reuse the methods and attributes of the parent class while also adding its own unique features.

## üîπ 1. Creating a Parent Class

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def introduce(self):
        print(f"Hi, I'm {self.name}")
```

### üîç Explanation:
- `__init__` is the constructor; it runs when the object is created.
- `introduce()` is a method that prints a greeting.

---

## üîπ 2. Creating a Child Class (Inheritance)

```python
class Student(Person):
    pass
```

### üîç Explanation:
- `Student` class inherits from `Person` using `(Person)`.
- `pass` means no additional code ‚Äî it still works because it inherits from `Person`.

```python
s = Student("Ali")
s.introduce()  # Output: Hi, I'm Ali
```

---

## üîπ 3. Adding New Methods to the Child Class

```python
class Student(Person):
    def study(self):
        print(f"{self.name} is studying.")
```

```python
s = Student("Bob")
s.introduce()  # Inherited from Person
s.study()      # Defined in Student
```

---

## üîπ 4. Overriding Methods

You can **change** how a method works in the child class.

```python
class Student(Person):
    def introduce(self):  # Overriding the method
        print(f"Hello, I'm student {self.name}")
```

```python
s = Student("Ahmad")
s.introduce()  # Output: Hello, I'm student Ahmad
```

---

## üîπ 5. Using `super()` to Call the Parent Method

If you override a method, but still want to use the original version from the parent, use `super()`.

```python
class Student(Person):
    def introduce(self):
        super().introduce()  # Call Person's version
        print("I'm also a student.")
```

```python
s = Student("Hamza")
s.introduce()
# Output:
# Hi, I'm Hamza
# I'm also a student.
```

---

## Multilevel Inheritance in Python

**Multilevel Inheritance** is a type of inheritance where a class (child class) inherits from another class (parent class), and then another class (grandchild class) inherits from the child class. This forms a chain of inheritance.

```
Person (Parent Class)
    ‚Ü≥ Student (Child Class)
        ‚Ü≥ GraduateStudent (Grandchild Class)
```

### Multilevel Inheritance Example: Person, Student, and GraduateStudent in Python

```python
class Person:
    def speak(self):
        print("Person speaks")

class Student(Person):
    def study(self):
        print("Student studies")

class GraduateStudent(Student):
    def research(self):
        print("Graduate student does research")

g = GraduateStudent()
g.speak()
g.study()
g.research()
```

### **Example: E-Commerce Product Catalog**

#### **Scenario**  
Different types of products (e.g., physical, digital, subscription) share common attributes but have unique behaviors. Inheritance helps avoid code duplication.

#### **Base Class**
```python
class Product:
    def __init__(self, name, price, sku):
        self.name = name
        self.price = price
        self.sku = sku

    def apply_discount(self, discount_percent):
        self.price *= (1 - discount_percent / 100)
        return self.price

    def get_description(self):
        return f"{self.name} (SKU: {self.sku}) - ${self.price:.2f}"
```

#### **Subclasses with Specialized Logic**
```python
class DigitalProduct(Product):
    def __init__(self, name, price, sku, file_size):
        super().__init__(name, price, sku)
        self.file_size = file_size  # Unique to digital products

    def download_link(self):
        return f"https://store.com/download/{self.sku}"

class PhysicalProduct(Product):
    def __init__(self, name, price, sku, weight):
        super().__init__(name, price, sku)
        self.weight = weight  # In grams

    def calculate_shipping(self):
        return max(5, self.weight * 0.01)  # $0.01 per gram, min $5

class SubscriptionProduct(Product):
    def __init__(self, name, price, sku, duration_months):
        super().__init__(name, price, sku)
        self.duration_months = duration_months

    def renew(self):
        print(f"Subscription renewed for {self.duration_months} months.")
```

#### **Usage**
```python
# Create instances
ebook = DigitalProduct("Python Guide", 29.99, "D123", "50MB")
tshirt = PhysicalProduct("Python T-Shirt", 19.99, "P456", 300)
subscription = SubscriptionProduct("Premium Access", 9.99, "S789", 12)

# Use inherited methods
ebook.apply_discount(10)  # Applies 10% discount
print(ebook.get_description())  # Output: "Python Guide (SKU: D123) - $26.99"

# Use subclass-specific methods
print(tshirt.calculate_shipping())  # Output: 5.0 (300g * $0.01 = $3, but min $5)
print(subscription.renew())         # Output: "Subscription renewed for 12 months."
```

---

*Keypoints*

1. **Code Reuse**: Common logic like `apply_discount` is defined once in the base class.
2. **Specialization**: Subclasses add unique attributes (`file_size`, `weight`) and methods (`download_link`, `calculate_shipping`).
3. **Polymorphism**: All products can be treated uniformly (e.g., stored in a list of `Product` objects).
4. **Extensibility**: New product types (e.g., `BundleProduct`) can be added without modifying existing code.

This example mirrors real-world systems like Shopify or WooCommerce, where inheritance simplifies managing diverse product types.

## üß† Summary

| Concept        | Description                                         |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `class Child(Parent)` | Defines a new class that inherits from Parent   |
| `super()`      | Calls a method from the parent class                |
| Method override| Redefine a parent method in the child class         |
| Reusability    | Inheritance helps reuse code and reduce repetition |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Forgetting to use `self` in methods.
- Not calling the parent class's `__init__` method when overriding it.
- Overriding a method but forgetting to use `super()` if needed.
