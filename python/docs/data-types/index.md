## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Variable Assignment and Basic Operations
1. Assign the value `5` to a variable named `x`.
2. Assign the value `10` to a variable named `y`.
3. Assign the sum of `x` and `y` to a variable named `sum_xy`.

## Review Questions

**Basic Data Types**

1. What are the basic data types in Python?
   - **Answer:** Python's basic data types include:
     1. **Numbers:** Integers (`int`), floating-point numbers (`float`), and complex numbers (`complex`).
     2. **Text:** Strings (`str`) to represent sequences of characters.
     3. **Logical Values:** Booleans (`bool`) for True or False.

2. How do you create a string in Python? Give an example.
3. What is the difference between an integer and a float in Python?
4. How do you convert a string to an integer in Python?
5. How can you convert a string to an integer and an integer to a string in Python? Provide examples.
6. What function would you use to find the type of a variable in Python?
7.  What is the purpose of the type() function in Python?

**Boolean and None**

6. What are the Boolean values in Python?
7. What does the None type represent in Python?
   - **Answer:** In Python, the None type represents the absence of a value or a null value. It is a built-in constant that is used to denote a lack of value or a null reference.
   - ### Characteristics of `None`
     1. **Singleton**: `None` is a singleton in Python, meaning there is only one instance of `None` in a Python runtime. All occurrences of `None` point to the same object.
    ```python
    a = None
    b = None
    print(a is b)  # Output: True
    ```

     2. **Type**: The type of `None` is `NoneType`.
    ```python
    print(type(None))  # Output: <class 'NoneType'>
    ```
     3. **Boolean Context**: `None` is treated as `False` in a boolean context.
    ```python
    if not None:
        print("None is considered False")  # Output: None is considered False
    ```
    - ### Checking for `None`
    - To check if a variable is `None`, use the `is` operator, as it checks for identity.
        ```python
        variable = None
        if variable is None:
            print("Variable is None")  # Output: Variable is None
        ```
8. How do you check if a variable is None?

   - **Answer:** To check if a variable is None in Python, you should use the is operator. The is operator checks for identity, meaning it checks whether two references point to the same object. Since None is a singleton in Python (there is only one instance of None in a Python runtime), using is is the correct and most efficient way to check for None.

```python
variable = None

if variable is None:
    print("Variable is None")
```

**Type Casting**

1.  How do you convert an integer to a string in Python?
2.  What is the result of int('123.45')?
3.  What does the str() function do?
4.  How do you safely convert a string to a float, considering the possibility of invalid input?
