## Variables

- Storage containers for data (numbers, text, etc.).

#### What is a variable

- A variable is a named storage location in a computer's memory that is used to hold data or values. It allows programmers to store and manipulate data within a program.

**Purpose:** Variables provide a way to store and manage data that can be used and manipulated throughout a program. They make programs more flexible and allow for dynamic data storage.

**Assignment statement:** in Python is used to assign a value to a variable. Its primary purpose is to store and manage data within a program.

**Imagine variables as labeled boxes:**

- You have boxes for storing different things (numbers, words, etc.).
- Each box has a name (label) to identify what's inside.
- You can put things in, take them out, and change what's inside.

**Example #1:** Storing a name

```python
name = "Muhammad Hamza"
print(name)
```

**Example #2:** Tracking a score:

```python
score = 0
score = score + 10 # adds 10 to the score
print(score)
```

**Example #3:** Remembering a favorite color

```python
favorite_color = "blue" #stores "blue"  in variable
print(favorite_color)
```

**Example #4:** Calculating the area of a rectangle

```python
length = 10
width = 5

# calculates the area
area = length * width
print(area)
```

**Key Points:**

- **[Choose meaningful names](https://youtube.com/shorts/lQy1Le8fnRs?si=kU0YflJx7lLzp_TT):** Use names that describe what the variable stores (e.g., pizza_slices instead of x).

- **Assign values using =:** The equals sign is used to put a value into a variable.
- **Change values:** You can update a variable's value later in your code.
- **Use variables in calculations and operations:** Variables can be used just like regular numbers or text in expressions.
- **Think of variables as placeholders:** They hold information that can change as your program runs.

**1. What is a variable in computer programming?**
**Answer:** A variable is a named storage location in a computer's memory that is used to hold data or values. It allows programmers to store and manipulate data within a program.

**2. What is the purpose of using variables in programming?**
**Answer:** Variables provide a way to store and manage data that can be used and manipulated throughout a program. They make programs more flexible and allow for dynamic data storage.

**3. What is the difference between declaring and initializing a variable?**
**Answer:** Declaring a variable involves specifying its name and data type, while initializing a variable means giving it an initial value. Initialization usually follows declaration but is not always required.
