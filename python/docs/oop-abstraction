6. Abstraction

Abstraction involves hiding the complex implementation details and exposing only the necessary functionality. This can be achieved using abstract classes (via the abc module), but we wonâ€™t go too deep into that for now.


Would you like to practice creating classes, inheritance, and encapsulation, or move on to something else, like exceptions and error handling?
