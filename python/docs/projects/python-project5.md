# Python Project: Animal Species Classification Using Machine Learning

**Project Title:** Animal Species Classification Using Machine Learning

**Project Domain / Category:** Data Science / Machine Learning

### Introduction:
The objective of this project is to build a web application that classifies animals into species based on their images. Leveraging machine learning and image processing techniques, you can train a model to recognize and predict the species of various animals based on distinctive features in their images. This project is ideal for anyone interested in exploring image classification and web development.

### Dataset Suggestions:
- **Animals-10 Dataset on Kaggle**: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessiocorrado99/animals10)
- **Animal Faces Dataset on UCI**: [UCI Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/animal+faces)

These datasets contain images of various animal species, including dogs, cats, lions, and tigers, with labeled data suitable for training and testing classification models.

### Functional Requirements for Web Application

#### 1. Getting User Input:
   - **User Interface**: Develop a simple web interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or a framework like Flask for Python) where users can upload an image of an animal.
   - **Image Upload**: Implement a file upload widget, allowing users to submit their image to the model for classification. HTML forms or drag-and-drop upload features can be used to enhance the experience.
   - **Image Handling**: Ensure the uploaded image is saved temporarily for processing by the machine learning model.

#### 2. Image Classification Process:
   - Once the image is uploaded, the web application should process it to predict the species using a machine learning model. This involves several steps:

#### i. Data Pre-processing:
   - **Data Cleaning**: Handle any missing or corrupted data within the dataset. Although images are less likely to have missing values, verify that all labels are available and images are readable.
   - **Image Resizing**: Resize all images to a consistent size, such as 128x128 pixels, to standardize input dimensions for the model.
   - **Normalization**: Normalize pixel values to a range of [0, 1] by dividing by 255. This improves the convergence rate of training by keeping the input scale uniform.
   - **Dataset Splitting**: Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets (e.g., 70% training, 15% validation, and 15% testing). The training set is for model training, the validation set helps in hyperparameter tuning, and the testing set evaluates the model’s final accuracy.

#### ii. Algorithm Selection:
   - **Model Selection**: Experiment with different classification algorithms to find the best-performing model:
     - **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**: CNNs are typically the best choice for image classification tasks, as they can automatically detect spatial hierarchies in images. Use custom CNN layers or pre-trained models.
     - **Pre-trained Models (Transfer Learning)**: Leverage models like **VGG16**, **ResNet**, or **InceptionV3**. These models, trained on large image datasets, can serve as feature extractors, reducing the need for extensive training.
     - **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** and **Random Forests**: These algorithms can also be applied if working with extracted features rather than raw images, though CNN-based models generally outperform these.

#### iii. Feature Extraction:
   - **CNN Feature Extraction**: Use a CNN (or a pre-trained model like VGG16 or ResNet) to extract high-level features from images automatically.
   - **Layer Tuning**: In transfer learning, freeze some layers of the pre-trained model and fine-tune only the top layers on the animal dataset to avoid overfitting and improve classification accuracy.

#### iv. Confusion Matrix:
   - **Evaluation Metrics**: Use a confusion matrix to evaluate the model's performance across all classes. Calculate and display metrics like:
     - **Accuracy**: The percentage of correct predictions.
     - **Precision**: The accuracy of the positive predictions.
     - **Recall**: The ability to find all relevant instances.
     - **F1-score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, useful for imbalanced datasets.

#### v. Model Implementation:
   - **Implementation Framework**: Choose either **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch** to implement the model.
   - **Training the Model**: Train the model using the training set and validate it on the validation set to avoid overfitting. Use techniques like **early stopping** and **dropout layers** for regularization.
   - **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experiment with hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size, number of layers) to improve model performance.

#### vi. Accuracy Evaluation:
   - **Testing the Model**: Evaluate the trained model on the testing dataset to measure its accuracy on unseen data.
   - **Model Comparison**: Compare the accuracy of different algorithms (e.g., CNN vs. pre-trained models) and select the best-performing one based on the test dataset's accuracy.
   - **Save the Model**: Save the best model as a file (e.g., `.h5` for Keras/TensorFlow models) for use in the web application.

#### 3. Display Class Name:
   - **Predict and Display Species Name**: Once the user uploads an image, the model should classify it and return the predicted species. Map the predicted class label (e.g., “cat,” “dog,” “lion”) to a human-readable species name and display it on the web page.
   - **Confidence Score**: Display the model's confidence in its prediction to indicate how certain it is about the result.

#### 4. Show the Accuracy:
   - **Prediction Accuracy**: If the ground truth label is available (for labeled test images), compare the predicted label with the actual label and display the prediction's accuracy on the web page.
   - **Confidence Interval**: Show a confidence interval or accuracy measure that reflects the reliability of the model's predictions.

### Additional Components (Optional):
   - **User Feedback Mechanism**: Allow users to provide feedback if the classification was correct or incorrect. This can help improve the model in future iterations.
   - **Class Activation Map (CAM)**: Use a Class Activation Map to highlight the parts of the image that contributed most to the classification. This is useful for explaining the model’s predictions and improving interpretability.

### Tools and Technologies
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: TensorFlow or PyTorch for deep learning, OpenCV or PIL for image processing.
- **Web Framework**: Flask (Python) for creating the web application backend.
- **Frontend Technologies**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the user interface.
- **Deployment**: Use platforms like Heroku or AWS for deploying the web application.
