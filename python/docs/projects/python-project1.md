# Python Project: Movie Ratings Analysis and Insights for a Streaming Service

**Project Title:** Movie Ratings Analysis and Insights for a Streaming Service

**Project Domain / Category:** Data Analysis / Entertainment Industry

### Introduction:
This project aims to analyze a dataset of movie ratings to uncover patterns in viewer preferences and behavior. By examining trends in movie genres, release years, and ratings, you can provide insights that may help a streaming service understand its audience better and make data-driven decisions on content acquisition and recommendation systems.

### Dataset Suggestions:
- **IMDb Movie Ratings:** [IMDb Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/PromptCloudHQ/imdb-data)
- **The Movie Database (TMDb) Ratings:** [TMDb Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata)
- **Netflix Movies and TV Shows:** [Netflix Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows)

These datasets contain information on movies, genres, release dates, viewer ratings, and potentially metadata like directors and actors, providing plenty of material for a comprehensive analysis.

### Functional Requirements for the Analysis:

1. **Data Collection and Pre-processing:**
   - **Data Loading:** Load the dataset using Pandas.
   - **Data Cleaning:**
     - Handle missing values and duplicates, particularly in key columns like titles, genres, and ratings.
     - Standardize the date columns (e.g., release dates) and ensure rating columns are in numerical format.
   - **Data Transformation:**
     - Extract useful features such as release year from date columns.
     - Convert genres into a format suitable for analysis, like one-hot encoding if multiple genres are listed for each movie.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - **Ratings Distribution:**
     - Analyze the distribution of movie ratings (e.g., average rating) across the dataset.
     - Use histograms to visualize the spread of ratings and identify any skewed patterns.
   - **Top Genres by Popularity:**
     - Determine which genres have the highest average ratings and viewer counts.
     - Use bar charts or pie charts to visualize genre popularity and ratings.
   - **Trending Movies by Year:**
     - Analyze the average rating or number of ratings over the years to see how the popularity of movies has changed.
     - Plot a line chart to show trends in ratings or movie counts over time.
   - **Top Directors or Actors (if available):**
     - Identify directors or actors with the highest-rated movies on average or most popular movies.
     - Visualize the results using bar charts to showcase the top names.

3. **Detailed Data Analysis:**
   - **Genre Correlation Analysis:**
     - Determine if certain genres tend to be rated higher than others, or if certain genres are frequently paired.
     - Use correlation heatmaps to visualize relationships among genres if applicable.
   - **Viewer Preferences by Genre and Rating:**
     - Analyze if viewers tend to rate specific genres higher or lower and if genre influences rating variance.
   - **Seasonal Movie Release Patterns:**
     - If the dataset has month-specific release dates, investigate if certain months yield higher ratings or more releases.
     - Plot movie releases by month to identify patterns.

4. **Visualization and Insights:**
   - **Matplotlib Visualizations:**
     - Use Matplotlib (and optionally Seaborn) for line charts, histograms, bar charts, and heatmaps to visualize patterns.
   - **Annotations and Labels:**
     - Add meaningful labels, titles, and annotations to make visualizations more informative and visually appealing.
   - **Insights Summary:**
     - Summarize key findings from the data, like top-rated genres, the most active years for movie releases, and common patterns in viewer ratings.

5. **Report and Recommendations:**
   - **Executive Summary:**
     - Summarize major insights, such as popular genres, high-rated directors, and trends in ratings.
   - **Recommendations:**
     - Provide recommendations based on the analysis, such as focusing on specific genres for new content, acquiring movies by high-rated directors, or promoting movies released in popular months.
   - **Additional Suggestions:**
     - Suggest potential improvements for the streaming service, such as targeted recommendations, highlighting movies in trending genres, or promoting high-rated movies from past years.

6. **Optional Feature: Prediction Model**
   - **Building a Simple Rating Prediction Model (Optional):**
     - Use machine learning (e.g., linear regression or decision trees) to predict a movieâ€™s rating based on its genre, director, and release year.
   - **Evaluate Model Performance:**
     - Use metrics like mean absolute error (MAE) or mean squared error (MSE) to evaluate the model and fine-tune it if needed.
   - **Application:** 
     - Use the model to estimate ratings for new or less popular movies and inform potential acquisitions or recommendations.
