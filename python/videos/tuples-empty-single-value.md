## **üì∫ Python Tutorial: How to create an Empty tuple and Single value tuple**  

This tutorial explains how to create empty and single value tuples in Python:
* ‚úîÔ∏è An empty tuple is a tuple with no elements, represented by an empty pair of parentheses \[[00:06](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGIWcYXj580&t=6)\]. It can be used as a placeholder when a tuple is expected, but there are no elements to include \[[00:19](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGIWcYXj580&t=19)\].
* ‚úîÔ∏è A single value tuple contains only one element, represented by a single value followed by a comma \[[00:32](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGIWcYXj580&t=32)\]. Without the comma, Python will interpret the value as a simple data type, not a tuple \[[00:48](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGIWcYXj580&t=48)\]. Single value tuples are useful when you want to create a tuple with only one value and you don't want to have a list \[[01:08](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGIWcYXj580&t=68)\].
