**Questions**

1. What is Big O notation?

- **Answer:** Big O notation is a mathematical concept used in computer science to describe how the performance of an algorithm changes as the size of the input data grows. It gives you an idea of the worst-case scenario for how long an algorithm will take to run or how much space (memory) it will need.
**Key Concepts:**
  1. **Input Size (n):** This is usually the size of the data you're working with. For example, if you're sorting a list of numbers, "n" would be the number of items in that list.

  2. **Operations:** When we talk about Big O, we're usually counting the number of basic operations an algorithm performs (like comparisons, assignments, etc.).

  3. **Growth Rate:** Big O notation helps us understand how the number of operations grows as the input size increases. This is important because even if an algorithm is fast for small inputs, it might become very slow for large inputs.

2. **List and briefly explain the common Big O notations used to describe the time complexity of algorithms.**

**Common Big O Notations:**

   1. **O(1):** **Constant time**. The algorithm takes the same amount of time, no matter how large the input is. Example: Accessing an element in an array by index.
   
   2. **O(n):** **Linear time**. The time it takes to run the algorithm increases directly in proportion to the size of the input. Example: Looping through all items in a list.
   
   3. **O(log n):** **Logarithmic time**. The algorithm's time grows slower as the input size increases. Example: Binary search in a sorted array.

   4. **O(n log n):** This is common in more efficient sorting algorithms like Merge Sort or Quick Sort.

   5. **O(n²):** **Quadratic time**. The time it takes to run the algorithm is proportional to the square of the input size. Example: Nested loops, like in Bubble Sort.

   6. **O(2^n):** **Exponential time**. The time doubles with each additional element in the input. Example: Recursive algorithms that solve a problem of size "n" by solving smaller sub-problems multiple times.

   7.  **O(n!):** **Factorial time**. The time grows extremely fast with the input size. Example: Generating all permutations of a list.

3.  Why is Big O Important?
    
- **Answer:** Big O notation helps you compare different algorithms and choose the one that will perform better, especially with large data sets. It focuses on the worst-case scenario, ensuring that the algorithm can handle the largest possible input efficiently.

**Example:**

Imagine you have a list of 1000 numbers, and you want to find a specific number.

- If you're using **O(n)** time (linear search), you might have to check each number, so it could take up to 1000 steps.
- If you're using **O(log n)** time (binary search), you could find the number in about 10 steps.

Big O notation helps you predict these differences in performance.

4. **Write a note on the Best Case, Average Case, and Worst Case scenarios of algorithms, including their significance in algorithm analysis.**
   
In algorithm analysis, the best, average, and worst cases describe the different scenarios that can occur depending on the input data. These cases help us understand how an algorithm performs under varying conditions.

1. **Best Case:**
   - **Definition:** The best-case scenario is when the algorithm performs the fewest possible operations. It represents the most favorable input situation where the algorithm completes its task as quickly as possible.
   - **Example:** For a linear search algorithm, the best case occurs when the target element is the first element in the list. The search completes in O(1) time.

2. **Average Case:**
   - **Definition:** The average case represents the expected time complexity for a typical input. It considers the performance of the algorithm over all possible inputs, averaged out.
   - **Example:** In a linear search, the average case assumes that the target element could be anywhere in the list. On average, it will take O(n/2) time, which simplifies to O(n).

3. **Worst Case:**
   - **Definition:** The worst-case scenario occurs when the algorithm takes the most time or operations to complete. It represents the most challenging input situation for the algorithm.
   - **Example:** For the linear search algorithm, the worst case happens when the target element is not in the list at all or is the last element. The search will take O(n) time.

- Why Are These Cases Important?
Understanding the best, average, and worst cases helps developers and computer scientists evaluate the efficiency of an algorithm across different scenarios. This knowledge is crucial for selecting the right algorithm for a given task, ensuring that it performs well under all potential conditions.

5. Find the computational complexity for the following loop:
```cpp
for (cnt1 = 0, i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    for (j = 1; j <= n; j++)
        cnt1++;
```

**Answer:** 

- The outer loop runs from `i = 1` to `i <= n`, so it executes `n` times.
- The inner loop runs from `j = 1` to `j <= n`, so it also executes `n` times for each iteration of the outer loop.

**Total operations:** `n` (outer loop) * `n` (inner loop) = `n^2`

**Complexity:** O(n²)

2. Why is a stack called a LIFO (Last In, First Out) structure? Provide an example that illustrates this concept.
3. Explain the difference between the push(el) and pop() operations in a stack.
4. Explain how to add the numbers 592 and 3,784 using stack data structures. Describe each step in detail, including all stack operations performed, and illustrate the state of the stacks at each step of the addition process
5. What is a queue, and how does it differ from a stack?
6. Explain the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle in the context of a queue.
7. How does the enqueue operation differ from the dequeue operation in a queue?
8. What will be the state of the queue after the following operations:
- enqueue(3)
- enqueue(7)
- dequeue()
- enqueue(10)?
9. If a queue initially contains the elements [2, 4, 6], what will the queue look like after one dequeue() and two enqueue(8) operations?
10. What is a priority queue, and how does it differ from a simple queue?
- **Answer:** A priority queue is a type of queue where elements are dequeued based on their priority rather than their order of arrival. Unlike a simple queue that follows the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle, a priority queue serves elements with higher priority first, regardless of their position in the queue.
11. Why might a priority queue be necessary in real-world scenarios?
- **Answer:** Priority queues are necessary when certain tasks, people, or processes need to be prioritized over others. Examples include giving priority to emergency vehicles at tollbooths or ensuring that a critical system process is executed before less important ones, even if it arrives later.
12. What are the two variations of linked lists used to represent priority queues?

**Questions**

1. **What is the purpose of recursive definitions in programming?**
   - **Answer:** Recursive definitions in programming are used to define functions that call themselves in order to solve a problem by breaking it down into simpler subproblems.

2. **What is the C++ code for calculating the factorial of a number using recursion?**
   - **Answer:** The C++ code for calculating the factorial of a number using recursion is:
     ```cpp
     unsigned int factorial(unsigned int n) {
         if (n == 0)
             return 1;
         else
             return n * factorial(n - 1);
     }
     ```

3. **What is Recrusive definition?** 
 
- A recursive definition is a method used to define a set or a concept in terms of itself. It typically consists of two main parts:

  1. **Anchor (or Ground Case):** This is the base case or the simplest, most fundamental element of the set. It represents the starting point or foundation of the recursive definition. For example, in the set of natural numbers, the anchor case is `0`. This case defines the initial element that other elements are built upon.

  2. **Recursive Rule:** This part provides the method for constructing new elements from the basic or previously defined elements. It describes how to generate more complex elements by applying certain operations to the elements already defined. In the case of the natural numbers, the recursive rule is: "If \( n \) is a natural number, then \( n + 1 \) is also a natural number." This rule allows for the generation of new numbers by incrementing the existing numbers.

To illustrate this with the example of natural numbers:

- **Anchor Case:** 0 is in the set of natural numbers \( N \). This establishes 0 as the starting point.

- **Recursive Rule:** If \( n \) is a natural number (i.e., \( n \in N \)), then \( n + 1 \) is also a natural number. This rule allows you to generate new numbers by adding 1 to any number that is already in the set.

- **Closure:** There are no other objects in the set \( N \) except those generated by the anchor case and the recursive rule. This means that every element of the set can be derived from the anchor case and the recursive rule, and nothing else is included.

In summary, recursive definitions use a base case to establish the starting point and recursive rules to build upon that base case, generating new elements in a structured manner. This approach is widely used in mathematics, computer science, and other fields to define and work with sets, sequences, and functions.

4. **What is the recursive definition of the factorial function? Provide an example to illustrate how it works.**

The factorial of a non-negative integer \( n \), denoted as \( n! \), is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to \( n \). It is defined recursively as follows:

1. **Anchor (Ground Case):**
   - The simplest case or the base case is defined. For the factorial function, the base case is:
     \[
     0! = 1
     \]
   - This means that the factorial of 0 is 1. This is the starting point for the recursion.

2. **Recursive Rule:**
   - This rule describes how to compute the factorial of a number greater than 0 using the factorial of a smaller number. It is defined as:
     \[
     n! = n x (n - 1)!
     \]
   - In other words, the factorial of \( n \) is \( n \) multiplied by the factorial of \( n - 1 \). This rule allows you to compute the factorial of any number greater than 0 by referring to the factorial of a smaller number.

3. **Closure (Exclusivity):**
   - The set of values that satisfy the recursive definition includes only those numbers generated by applying the anchor case and recursive rule. No other values are part of the set.

### Example of Recursive Definition for Factorials

To compute \( 4! \) using the recursive definition:

1. **Start with the number 4:**
   \[
   4! = 4 x (4 - 1)!
   \]
   \[
   4! = 4 x 3!
   \]

2. **Compute \( 3! \) using the same rule:**
   \[
   3! = 3 x (3 - 1)!
   \]
   \[
   3! = 3 x 2!
   \]

3. **Compute \( 2! \) using the same rule:**
   \[
   2! = 2 x (2 - 1)!
   \]
   \[
   2! = 2 x 1!
   \]

4. **Compute \( 1! \) using the same rule:**
   \[
   1! = 1 x (1 - 1)!
   \]
   \[
   1! = 1 x 0!
   \]

5. **Use the anchor case to determine \( 0! \):**
   \[
   0! = 1
   \]

6. **Substitute back into the previous calculations:**
   \[
   1! = 1 x 0! = 1 x 1 = 1
   \]
   \[
   2! = 2 x 1 = 2
   \]
   \[
   3! = 3 x 2 = 6
   \]
   \[
   4! = 4 x 6 = 24
   \]

Thus, \( 4! = 24 \), which is the result of applying the recursive definition and the base case.

In summary, the recursive definition for the factorial function includes a base case (anchor) that provides the simplest value and a recursive rule that builds upon this value to compute factorials of larger numbers. This approach elegantly captures the essence of the factorial function through a self-referential process.
