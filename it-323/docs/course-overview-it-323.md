# Weekly Teaching Schedule for IT-323 Python Programming

**Course Title:** Python Programming
**Course Code:** IT-323
**Credit Hours:** 3(2-1)

**Course Objectives:** The purpose of this course is to provide a practical introduction to basic procedural
programming skills using Python programming language from scratch.

## **Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs)**  

At the end of the course, you should be able to: 

1. **Understand the Basics of Python Programming**  
   - Explain fundamental programming concepts.  
   - Set up and use Python development environments.  
   - Work with input, output, and variables of different data types.  

2. **Implement Control Structures and Loops**  
   - Use decision-making structures (`if`, `if-else`, `if-elif-else`).  
   - Apply `for` and `while` loops for repetition.  
   - Utilize Boolean logic, relational, and arithmetic operators.  

3. **Work with Data Structures and String Manipulation**  
   - Perform operations on strings (formatting, slicing, searching).  
   - Create and manipulate lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.  
   - Utilize list comprehension for efficient coding.  

4. **Develop Modular and Efficient Programs**  
   - Define and call user-defined functions with appropriate arguments.  
   - Use lambda functions and store functions in modules.  
   - Work with NumPy arrays for numerical computations.  

5. **Handle Errors and Improve Code Reliability**  
   - Identify and resolve programming errors.  
   - Implement exception handling (`try-except`).
