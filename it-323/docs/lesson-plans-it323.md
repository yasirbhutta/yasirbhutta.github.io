# Lesson Plan: IT-323 Python Programming 3(2-1)

## **Week #: Control Flow Statements**  

### **Lecture #: While Loops in Python**  

#### **Learning Objectives:**  

By the end of this lecture, students will be able to:  
✅ Understand the syntax and working of the `while` loop in Python.  
✅ Implement `while` loops to perform repetitive tasks based on a condition.  
✅ Use `while` loops to solve real-world problems such as printing sequences, summing numbers, and generating multiplication tables.
✅ Apply `while` loops with conditional statements to control program flow.

#### **Topics Covered:**

1. **Introduction to While Loops**
   - Definition and syntax of the `while` loop.
   - How a while loop executes based on a condition.
   
2. **Basic Examples**
   - Printing numbers from 1 to 10 using a `while` loop.
   - Printing "Hello, world!" multiple times.
   
3. **Using While Loops in Mathematical Computations**
   - Generating multiplication tables.
   - Summing integers from 1 to 100.
   - Calculating the sum of even numbers in a range.
   - Computing squares of numbers. 

2. **Hands-on Activity: Basic While Loop Practice** 
   - Modify the given example to print numbers from 1 to 20 instead of 1 to 10.
   - Change the "Hello, world!" loop to print a user-defined number of times.
   - Modify the sum-from-1-to-100 program to sum only odd numbers from 1 to 100.
