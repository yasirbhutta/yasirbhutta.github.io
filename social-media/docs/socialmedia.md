### Get You Started

LinkedIn is a powerful tool for students, offering a platform to build your professional network, showcase your skills and achievements, and explore career opportunities. But navigating this professional social media platform can be daunting at first. These handouts will guide you through the basics of creating a strong LinkedIn profile, networking effectively, and landing your dream internship or job.

### Building Your Profile

**Headline:** This is your first impression, so make it count! Craft a clear and concise headline that summarizes your skills and goals. (e.g., "Marketing Student | Passionate about social media and branding" or "Computer Science Major | Seeking web development internship")
**Profile Picture:** Use a professional headshot that shows your face clearly. Avoid selfies, group shots, or inappropriate images.
**Summary:** This is your chance to tell your story. Briefly highlight your skills, experience, and career aspirations.
**Experience:** List your academic and extracurricular activities, internships, volunteer work, and any relevant projects. Use keywords to make your profile searchable.
**Skills & Endorsements:** Add your skills and get endorsements from your connections. This helps recruiters find you and assess your qualifications.
**Recommendations:** Ask professors, mentors, or employers for recommendations to add credibility to your profile.
