## What is Paragraph Formatting

- You can apply paragraph formatting on paragraphs in document.
- A paragraph may be a character, a word, a line or multiple lines.
- Whenever the user presses Enter key, MS Word assumes that it is a next paragraph.
- A paragraph can be identified by paragraph mark ¶ 
- Only the cursor should be in paragraph to apply formatting. 


**Automatically Insert Sample Text into a Document:**

```excel
=RAND()
=RAND(X,Y) where... X= the number of paragraphs you want Y= the number of sentences each paragraph should have
```

## 1. Alignment

- Horizontal alignment determines the appearance and orientation of the edges of the paragraph:
 left-aligned text, 
right-aligned text
centered text, 
justified text, which is aligned evenly along the left and right margins. 
For example, in a paragraph that is left-aligned (the most common alignment), the left edge of the paragraph is flush with the left margin.

**Types of paragraph alignment:**

- **Left alignment:** Aligns text on left margin. This is the default paragraph alignment.
- **Right alignment:** Aligns text on the right margin.
- **Center alignment:** is evenly centered between the left and right margins.
- **Justified Alignment:** aligns text on both left and right margins. Justified alignment may add spaces between words to extend your text so that it fits between margins. 

Left-align, center, right-align, or justify text within a paragraph.

## 2. Indentation

- Indentation determines the distance of the paragraph from either the left or the right margin. 
Indent can be set for individual paragraph or a group of paragraphs.

## Types of Indents

**Left Indent:** Move in the left side of the paragraph by certain amount from left page margin. 
**First Line Indent:** A first line indent inserts space between the first line and the page margin.
**Hanging Indent:** In which the first line of the paragraph is not indented, but subsequent lines are.
**Right Indent:** Move in the right side of the paragraph by certain amount from right page margin. 

Adjust the indentation (left or right) for paragraphs.

- Use Decrease Indent to remove extra space from the left of the entire paragraph.
- Use Increase Indent to add extra space to the left of the entire paragraph.

## 3. Line and Paragraph Spacing

Adjust the space between lines of text or between paragraphs 1.

## 4. Bulleted and Numbered Lists

Create bulleted or numbered lists using the Bulleted List and Numbered List commands.

## 5. Columns

- A document may begin with a single column format  
- Text formatted in Multiple columns occupies more page space than if it is formatted in Single Column
- The white spaces needed between columns takes extra page 
- Text presented in a multiple column structure flows from the bottom of the first column to the top of the next column
It can be changed to two columns in the middle of the page by applying two column style from that point
