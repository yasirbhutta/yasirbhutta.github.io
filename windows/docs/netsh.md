Goal: Remove a custom firewall rule to prevent traffic on a specific port.


16. View Wireless Network Signal Strength

Task: Check the signal strength of your connected Wi-Fi network.

Command:

netsh wlan show interfaces

Goal: Monitor the signal quality and strength of your wireless network connection.


17. Enable/Disable a Network Interface

Task: Enable or disable a specific network interface on your machine.

Command:

Enable:

netsh interface set interface name="Ethernet" admin=enabled

Disable:

netsh interface set interface name="Ethernet" admin=disabled


Goal: Practice controlling the status of a network interface.


18. Export Wireless Network Profiles

Task: Export the settings of a specific Wi-Fi network profile to an XML file.

Command:

netsh wlan export profile name="WiFiName" folder="C:\Users\YourName\Desktop"

Goal: Backup Wi-Fi profiles for use on another machine or as a configuration reference.


19. Import a Wireless Network Profile

Task: Import a previously exported Wi-Fi network profile from an XML file.

Command:

netsh wlan add profile filename="C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\WiFiName.xml"

Goal: Restore or transfer a Wi-Fi network profile from a backup XML file.
