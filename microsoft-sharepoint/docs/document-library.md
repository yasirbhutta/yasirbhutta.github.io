## 1. ✅ What is a SharePoint Document Library?

A **document library** in SharePoint is a secure place to store files where you and your team can easily find them, work on them together, and access them from any device.

---

## 2. 🛠️ How to Use SharePoint Library for Document Management

---

### 1. **Access or Create a Document Library**

* Go to your **SharePoint site**.
* From the left navigation, click **"Documents"** (default library), or:

  * Click the **gear icon** > **Site Contents** > **+ New** > **Document Library**.
  * Give it a name and click **Create**.

---

### 2. **Upload Files and Folders**

* Open the library.
* Click **Upload** > **Files** or **Folder**.
* Drag and drop files directly into the library window.

---

### 3. **Create New Files**

* Click **New** > Choose file type (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc.).
* Files are saved directly in the library.

---

### 4. **Organize with Folders or Metadata**

* Use **folders** to group documents by type, department, or project.
* Or, use **columns (metadata)** like “Document Type,” “Department,” or “Status” for advanced filtering and sorting.

  * Click **+ Add Column** to create custom metadata.

---

### 5. **Version History**

* SharePoint tracks all changes:

  * Right-click on a document > **Version history** to view, restore, or delete previous versions.

---

### 6. **Check-in / Check-out**

Useful when you want to edit a file without others overwriting it.

* Right-click file > **Check out**.
* Edit file.
* Right-click > **Check in** to make changes visible.

---

### 7. **Share Files Securely**

* Right-click file > **Share**.
* Choose people (internal or external), set permissions (View/Edit), and send.

---

### 8. **Set Permissions**

* Click **Library Settings** > **Permissions for this document library**.
* Customize who can view, edit, or manage files.

---

### 9. **Automate with Workflows or Power Automate**

* Use **Power Automate (formerly Flow)** to automate approvals, email alerts, or document routing.

---

### 10. **Sync with OneDrive**

* Click **Sync** to sync library to your desktop using **OneDrive**.
* Access files offline and auto-sync changes.

---

## 💡 Best Practices

* Use **clear folder names or metadata**.
* Avoid deeply nested folders (use filters and views instead).
* Enable **version control** and **document check-out** for collaboration.
* Train team members on consistent usage.
