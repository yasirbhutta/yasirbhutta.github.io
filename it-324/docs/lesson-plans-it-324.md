# Lesson Plan: for IT-324 Web Development 3(2-1)

## **Week #3: HTML Form Controls & Attributes**  

### **Lecture: Exploring HTML Input Controls & Attributes**  

#### **Learning Objectives:**  
By the end of this session, students will be able to:  
✅ Understand and implement various HTML form input controls.  
✅ Use **email control** to validate user email input.  
✅ Implement **file control** for file uploads in forms.  
✅ Utilize the **reset button** to clear form data.  
✅ Apply the **placeholder attribute** to improve form usability.  

#### **Topics Covered:**  
1. **Email Input Field (`<input type="email">`)**  
   - Ensures users enter a valid email address.  
   - Built-in validation in modern browsers.  

2. **File Input Control (`<input type="file">`)**  
   - Allows users to upload files.  
   - Accepts attributes like `multiple` and `accept` for file type restrictions.  

3. **Reset Button (`<input type="reset">`)**  
   - Clears all form inputs when clicked.  
   - Use cases and limitations.  

4. **Placeholder Attribute (`placeholder="Enter text"`)**  
   - Provides a hint inside the input field.  
   - Improves user experience but should not replace labels.
