# **Search Skill Assignment: Comparing CapCut with Other Video Editing Apps**

## **Objective:**
The goal of this assignment is to enhance students' ability to search effectively and critically evaluate information. By comparing CapCut with other video editing software, students will develop valuable search skills and gain insights into different tools available for video editing.

## **Instructions:**
1. **Research Phase:**
   - **Task**: Students should explore how CapCut compares to other video editing apps.
   - **Search Queries**:
     - Search queries like:
       - "CapCut vs. [Other Video Editing App]"
       - "Comparative review of CapCut and [Other App]"
       - "Features of CapCut compared to [Other App]"
   - **Sources**:
     - Students should look for reliable sources such as technology blogs, video editing forums, and reputable websites.
     - Consider using platforms like YouTube, Reddit, and tech-related websites.
   - **Note**: Remind students to critically evaluate the credibility of the sources they find.

2. **Evaluate and Compare**:
   - **Features Comparison**:
     - Students should identify key features of CapCut (e.g., effects, transitions, audio editing) and compare them to similar features in other apps.
     - Look for user reviews, tutorials, or official documentation.
   - **User Experiences**:
     - Encourage students to read or watch user experiences with both CapCut and the other app.
     - Consider factors like ease of use, performance, and overall satisfaction.
   - **Pros and Cons**:
     - Ask students to create a list of pros and cons for each app.
     - Which app excels in specific areas? Where does it fall short?

3. **Critical Thinking**:
   - **Bias Awareness**:
     - Discuss potential biases in reviews or comparisons. Are there any sponsored articles or hidden affiliations?
     - Encourage students to consider multiple viewpoints.
   - **Context Matters**:
     - Remind students that the "best" app depends on individual needs. What works for a professional filmmaker might not be ideal for a casual user.
     - Consider use cases (e.g., social media content, professional projects).

4. **Assignment Submission**:
   - Students can present their findings in various formats:
     - Written report
     - Infographic
     - Presentation
     - Video review (using CapCut, of course!)
   - Emphasize clear communication and evidence-based conclusions.

## **Assessment Criteria:**
- Thoroughness of research
- Critical evaluation of sources
- Clear comparison of features
- Thoughtful analysis of user experiences
- Balanced pros and cons assessment
