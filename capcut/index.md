## Interface

**Setting the Stage: The CapCut Workspace**

**1. Timeline:** 
- The timeline in CapCut is the main workspace where you arrange and edit your video project. It's essentially a visual representation of your video's structure and timing. 

**1.1. Displaying and Arranging Clips:**
  - When you import videos, photos, or audio files into your project, you drag and drop them onto the timeline. Each clip appears as a separate block.
  - By dragging and repositioning these clip blocks on the timeline, you determine the order in which they appear in your final video.

**1.2. Editing Clip Length:**
  - The length of each clip block on the timeline reflects the clip's duration.
  - You can adjust the clip's length by dragging its edges on the timeline. Dragging the right edge extends the clip, while dragging the left edge shortens it.

**1.3. Previewing and Playback:**
  - The timeline has a playhead (usually a vertical white line) that indicates the current playback position.
  - By dragging the playhead or using the playback controls, you can preview specific sections of your video project on the screen above the timeline.

**1.4. Multiple Tracks:**
  - The timeline typically has multiple tracks. This allows you to layer different elements of your video project, such as separate video clips, audio tracks, and text overlays.
  - By arranging elements on different tracks, you can control which ones appear on top of each other in the final video.

**1.5. Editing Tools:**
  - The timeline provides access to various editing tools. You can split clips, trim unwanted sections, adjust volume levels of audio tracks, and add transitions between clips.

**2. Editing Tools (Bottom):** This toolbar appears at the bottom of your screen whenever you don't have a clip selected on the timeline. It provides the main editing functions for your entire project.

**3. Preview Window (Center):** You can preview your edits in real-time as you make changes.
  - Use the play/pause button to preview your edits.

## Importing & Project Setup

**Creating a New Project:**

* Tap the "+ New project" button (usually on the main screen) to start a new project.

**Importing Your Media:**

* There are two ways to import your clips:

    1. **The Import Button:** Tap the "Import" button and browse your device's storage to select the photos and videos you want to use.
    2. **Drag & Drop (Desktop Only):** In the editing window, locate your media files in your device's file manager and drag them directly onto the CapCut editing window.

## Module 2: Editing Fundamentals

### Trimming & Splitting

Trimming and splitting in CapCut are two different ways to shorten or edit your video clips:

**Trimming:** This allows you to remove unwanted sections from the beginning or end of a clip. Imagine cutting off the "excess fat" at the edges.

**Splitting:** This cuts your clip into two separate clips at a specific point. 

**Uses for Trimming and Splitting:**

* **Removing unwanted sections:** Cut out mistakes, pauses, or irrelevant parts of your video.
* **Creating a faster-paced video:** Trim off unnecessary silence or slow moments to create a more dynamic video.
* **Creating multiple clips:** Split a long clip into smaller sections for easier editing or rearranging them in a different order.

**Trimming:**

1. **Select the clip** you want to trim in the timeline.
2. **Drag the white handles** at the beginning or end of the clip to shorten it.
    * Drag the left handle to remove the beginning.
    * Drag the right handle to remove the ending.

**Splitting (Mobile App):**

1. **Select the clip** you want to split. 
2. **Tap the "Split" icon** (scissors symbol) on the toolbar. 

Now you have two separate clips!

**How to split and remove an unwanted video (Mobile App)**

**Step 1: Import your video**

* Launch CapCut and tap the "+" button to start a new project.
* Import your video into the editing window.

**Step 2: Locate the unwanted section**

* Play the video in the preview window and identify the part you want to remove.

**Step 3: Split the clip (at the beginning of the unwanted section)**

* Tap on the video clip in the timeline to select it.
* Move the playhead to the exact point where the unwanted section starts.
* Tap the "Split" icon (scissors symbol) on the toolbar 

**Step 4: Split the clip again (at the end of the unwanted section)**

* Now you have two clips. Select the clip containing the unwanted section.
* Move the playhead to the exact point where the unwanted section ends.
* Tap "Split" again to create three separate clips.

**Step 5: Delete the unwanted section**

* Select the unwanted clip in the middle (the one you want to remove).
* Tap the **Delete** icon on the toolbar.

**Class Activity:**

    - **Task B:** Trim any awkward pauses or silent moments at the end of your clip until the video cuts to the action.

3. **Splitting Scene!** Find a place in your clip where the action changes or a new scene begins. 
    - **Task A:** Split the clip at this point to create two separate clips.
    - **Task B:** Combine trimming and splitting to create a completely different narrative from your original clip.

### Merging & Arranging Clips  
- Learn to combine clips seamlessly and structure your video.

### Adding Text & Stickers
- Enhance your videos with titles, captions, and fun graphics.

**Add Text**
**Stickers**

- Stickers in video editing software are graphic elements you can add to your videos to enhance their visual appeal and convey information in a fun or informative way. They function like digital stickers you might use on photos but with the added benefit of animation in some cases.

Here's a breakdown of what stickers offer in video editing:

- **Visual Interest:** Stickers can add a playful or decorative touch to your video, grabbing attention and making it more visually engaging.
- **Highlight Information:** You can use stickers to point out key elements in your video, add emphasis to specific parts, or illustrate concepts in a creative way.
- **Brand Identity:** Stickers can incorporate your brand logo or mascot, subtly reinforcing your brand identity throughout the video.
- **Emotional Impact:** Stickers can be used to convey emotions or humor, depending on the design and how you use them in your video.

There are two main types of stickers you'll typically find in video editing software:

1.  **Static Stickers:** These are simple graphic images that don't move. They come in a wide variety of designs, from emojis and smileys to thematic stickers related to holidays, hobbies, or specific topics.

2.  **Animated Stickers:** These stickers incorporate animation, adding movement and bringing your visuals to life. This can be anything from simple animations like a bouncing emoji to more complex animations that interact with your video content.

**Text to Speech:**

- Text-to-speech (TTS) in video editing software allows you to convert written text into a voiceover that you can add to your video. This is a helpful feature for various scenarios:

**Creating a Voiceover:** If you don't want to record your own voiceover narration, TTS can generate a voice to read your script.
**Multiple Languages:** You can create videos with voiceovers in different languages using TTS options with various language support.
**Adding Emphasis or Narration:** TTS can be used for specific parts of your video, like adding narration to text overlays or highlighting key points.

**Auto Captions:**

- Autocaption in video editing is a feature that automatically generates captions (or subtitles) for your videos based on the audio content. This is a fantastic tool for several reasons:

**Accessibility:** It makes your videos more accessible to viewers who are deaf or hard of hearing, allowing them to follow along with the dialogue.
**Non-English Speakers:** Captions can also be helpful for viewers who speak a different language from the one spoken in the video.
**Watching Without Sound:** Captions are useful for people watching your video in situations where they can't turn on the sound, like on public transportation or in a library.

**Aspect ratio:**

Aspect ratio is the proportional relationship between the width and height of a rectangle. It's expressed as a colon-separated pair of numbers like width:height (e.g., 16:9, 4:3).
Common aspect ratios are used in various fields such as photography, videography, and graphic design.  For instance, a 16:9 aspect ratio is ideal for widescreen TVs and monitors, while a 4:3 ratio is suitable for standard-definition TVs and presentations.

Capcut allows you to choose from various aspect ratios to suit your video editing needs. The app supports popular ratios like 16:9 (widescreen), 9:16 (ideal for TikTok and Instagram stories), 4:3 (standard definition TV), 1:1 (square format for social media posts), and more.

### **Keyframe Animations:** 

Keyframing is a feature that allows you to create motion graphics and smooth animation. To create a motion sequence, you need to define your object's starting and ending points. These markers are referred to as the keyframes. Use CapCut to employ video keyframes with our easy-to-use user interface. Besides keyframe effects, you can add speed curve to smooth your video clips. Learn more: [Keyframe Animations - capcut.com](https://www.capcut.com/tools/keyframe-animation)

Here are some examples of how keyframes can be used in CapCut:

 - Zoom in on a clip: You can use keyframes to create a zooming effect, where you gradually enlarge a specific part of your clip. This can be used to draw attention to a particular detail or create a sense of focus.

 - Rotate text: Keyframes can be used to rotate text elements in your CapCut project. This can be a fun way to add dynamism to your text overlays or create a more playful l[ook.

 - Fade in or out an image: You can use keyframes to control the opacity of an image overlay in your CapCut project. This allows you to fade an image in or out smoothly, creating a more polished look.

 - Create a bouncing effect: Keyframes can be used to animate the position of an element in your CapCut project, allowing you to create bouncing or moving elements. This can be a great way to add a touch of whimsy to your video.

 - Animate color changes: Keyframes can also be used to animate the color of elements in your CapCut project. This can be used to create a color shift effect or to match the colors of your video to the mood or theme you're going for.

**How to add keyframes in CapCut?**

**Step 1: Start a new project**
Access CapCut's well-rounded editor via a web browser. Click 'Create new video' and select the appropriate ratio for your project. Upload relevant media to the cloud or start with stock videos and add them to the multitrack editor.

Click the keyframe icon to add it to the clips as you want, and then adjust the parameters for perfect animation. Want to make your video stand out? Make the best of other robust editing tools. For instance, apply a speed curve to make your action movie gripping and thrilling.
