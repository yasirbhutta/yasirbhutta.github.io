## Interface

**Setting the Stage: The CapCut Workspace**

**1. Timeline:** 
- The timeline in CapCut is the main workspace where you arrange and edit your video project. It's essentially a visual representation of your video's structure and timing. 

**1.1. Displaying and Arranging Clips:**
  - When you import videos, photos, or audio files into your project, you drag and drop them onto the timeline. Each clip appears as a separate block.
  - By dragging and repositioning these clip blocks on the timeline, you determine the order in which they appear in your final video.

**1.2. Editing Clip Length:**
  - The length of each clip block on the timeline reflects the clip's duration.
  - You can adjust the clip's length by dragging its edges on the timeline. Dragging the right edge extends the clip, while dragging the left edge shortens it.

**1.3. Previewing and Playback:**
  - The timeline has a playhead (usually a vertical white line) that indicates the current playback position.
  - By dragging the playhead or using the playback controls, you can preview specific sections of your video project on the screen above the timeline.

**1.4. Multiple Tracks:**
  - The timeline typically has multiple tracks. This allows you to layer different elements of your video project, such as separate video clips, audio tracks, and text overlays.
  - By arranging elements on different tracks, you can control which ones appear on top of each other in the final video.

**1.5. Editing Tools:**
  - The timeline provides access to various editing tools. You can split clips, trim unwanted sections, adjust volume levels of audio tracks, and add transitions between clips.

**2. Editing Tools (Bottom):** This toolbar appears at the bottom of your screen whenever you don't have a clip selected on the timeline. It provides the main editing functions for your entire project.

**3. Preview Window (Center):** You can preview your edits in real-time as you make changes.
  - Use the play/pause button to preview your edits.

## Importing & Project Setup

**Creating a New Project:**

* Tap the "+ New project" button (usually on the main screen) to start a new project.

**Importing Your Media:**

* There are two ways to import your clips:

    1. **The Import Button:** Tap the "Import" button and browse your device's storage to select the photos and videos you want to use.
    2. **Drag & Drop (Desktop Only):** In the editing window, locate your media files in your device's file manager and drag them directly onto the CapCut editing window.

## Module 2: Editing Fundamentals

### Trimming & Splitting

Trimming and splitting in CapCut are two different ways to shorten or edit your video clips:

**Trimming:** This allows you to remove unwanted sections from the beginning or end of a clip. Imagine cutting off the "excess fat" at the edges.

**Splitting:** This cuts your clip into two separate clips at a specific point. 

**Uses for Trimming and Splitting:**

* **Removing unwanted sections:** Cut out mistakes, pauses, or irrelevant parts of your video.
* **Creating a faster-paced video:** Trim off unnecessary silence or slow moments to create a more dynamic video.
* **Creating multiple clips:** Split a long clip into smaller sections for easier editing or rearranging them in a different order.

**Trimming:**

1. **Select the clip** you want to trim in the timeline.
2. **Drag the white handles** at the beginning or end of the clip to shorten it.
    * Drag the left handle to remove the beginning.
    * Drag the right handle to remove the ending.

**Splitting (Mobile App):**

1. **Select the clip** you want to split. 
2. **Tap the "Split" icon** (scissors symbol) on the toolbar.

![text template](docs/img/text_template_512.png)

**Stickers:**

- Stickers in video editing software are graphic elements you can add to your videos to enhance their visual appeal and convey information in a fun or informative way. They function like digital stickers you might use on photos but with the added benefit of animation in some cases.

![stickers](docs/img/stickers_512.png)

Here's a breakdown of what stickers offer in video editing:

- **Visual Interest:** Stickers can add a playful or decorative touch to your video, grabbing attention and making it more visually engaging.
- **Highlight Information:** You can use stickers to point out key elements in your video, add emphasis to specific parts, or illustrate concepts in a creative way.
- **Brand Identity:** Stickers can incorporate your brand logo or mascot, subtly reinforcing your brand identity throughout the video.
- **Emotional Impact:** Stickers can be used to convey emotions or humor, depending on the design and how you use them in your video.

There are two main types of stickers you'll typically find in video editing software:

1.  **Static Stickers:** These are simple graphic images that don't move. They come in a wide variety of designs, from emojis and smileys to thematic stickers related to holidays, hobbies, or specific topics.

2.  **Animated Stickers:** These stickers incorporate animation, adding movement and bringing your visuals to life. This can be anything from simple animations like a bouncing emoji to more complex animations that interact with your video content.

**Auto Captions:**

- Autocaption in video editing is a feature that automatically generates captions (or subtitles) for your videos based on the audio content. This is a fantastic tool for several reasons:

**Accessibility:** It makes your videos more accessible to viewers who are deaf or hard of hearing, allowing them to follow along with the dialogue.
**Non-English Speakers:** Captions can also be helpful for viewers who speak a different language from the one spoken in the video.
**Watching Without Sound:** Captions are useful for people watching your video in situations where they can't turn on the sound, like on public transportation or in a library.

Learn more: [Animations](https://www.capcut.com/create/animation-maker)

**How can I create animated videos?**

CapCut is a video editor that can be used to create animated videos. Here are three steps to create an animated video using CapCut:
1. Choose your animation style: CapCut offers different animation styles to choose from, such as motion graphics, 2D animation, and more.
2. Create your animation: Use CapCut's animation tools to create your desired animation. You can add text, shapes, and images to create a visually appealing animation.
3. Export and share: Once you've finished creating your animated video, export it in the desired format and share it on your preferred platform, such as YouTube or Instagram.

**Auto reframe:**

Auto reframe in CapCut is a feature that helps you adjust your video's aspect ratio to fit different social media platforms or project requirements. It essentially crops and resizes your video automatically, keeping the important content in focus.

Here's a breakdown of what auto reframe does:

**Saves Time:** It automates the resizing process, eliminating the need for manual cropping and zooming, which can be tedious.
**Adapts for Different Platforms:** Social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube have different aspect ratio requirements. Auto reframe helps you easily reformat your video for each platform without losing the core content.
**Focuses on the Subject:** CapCut's auto reframe (especially in the Pro version for PC) often uses artificial intelligence to detect the main subject in your video (people, objects) and prioritizes keeping that subject in the frame during resizing.

### Filters

Filters in CapCut are essentially preset color adjustments that you can apply to your videos to completely transform their look and feel. They offer a quick and easy way to achieve specific visual styles or moods in your editing.

Here's a breakdown of what filters do in CapCut:

- **Change Color Style:** Filters can dramatically alter the color palette of your video. This can involve making it warmer, cooler, more vibrant, or even black and white.
- **Set the Mood:** Different filters can evoke various moods or atmospheres. For instance, a vintage filter might create a nostalgic feel, while a neon filter might lend an energetic vibe.
- **Theme Enhancement:** Filters can help you achieve a particular theme for your video. Maybe you're going for a cinematic look or a dreamy aesthetic - filters can provide a starting point for that.

**Benefits of using filters in CapCut:**

- **Simple and Efficient:** Applying filters is a quick and effortless way to enhance your videos without needing advanced color grading techniques.
- **Diverse Range:** CapCut offers a wide variety of filters, from subtle adjustments to dramatic effects, allowing you to explore different creative directions.
- **Customization:** While filters provide presets, you often have the option to fine-tune the intensity of the filter to achieve the exact look you desire.

**Class activity:**

**Task A:** Apply Black and White Filter on video clip (Filters > Mono > BW1, BW2, BW3) 
  
**Camera tracking:**

CapCut's camera tracking isn't quite like physically moving a camera in the real world. Instead, it's a powerful **motion tracking** feature that utilizes artificial intelligence (AI). Here's how it works:

- **Tracks Objects:** You select a specific object (person, animal, item) in your video footage. 
- **AI Analyzes Movement:** CapCut's AI then tracks the movement of that chosen object throughout the video. 
- **Synchronized Effects:** This allows you to effortlessly add text, stickers, overlays, or even other video clips that will stay locked onto the tracked object. They'll move and adjust their position to seamlessly follow the object as it moves in your footage.

**Benefits of Camera Tracking in CapCut:**

- **Dynamic and Engaging Videos:** By having elements move in sync with objects, you can create a more dynamic and visually interesting video compared to static overlays.
- **Simplified Editing:**  Motion tracking saves time and effort.  Instead of manually animating elements to follow the object, CapCut automates it.
- **Creative Possibilities:**  This feature opens doors to creative applications. Imagine text bubbles appearing above someone's head as they talk, or a product logo hovering next to a highlighted item.

**Opacity:** Control the transparency of your text. A higher opacity makes the text more solid, while a lower opacity creates a see-through effe

### Text Animations

- CapCut offers a variety of text animations to add life and excitement to your videos. Here's a breakdown of the different types of text animations available:

Entrance and Exit Animations:

**Fade In/Out:** A classic animation where the text gradually appears or disappears.
**Fly In/Out:** Text enters or exits the frame from a specific direction (top, bottom, sides) with a smooth motion.
**Zoom In/Out:** Text enlarges or shrinks to create an emphasis or dramatic effect.

Movement Animations:

**Typewriter:** Simulates the effect of a typewriter with each letter appearing individually.
**Slide In:** Text slides horizontally or vertically into the frame.

### Lasting Text

- In CapCut, "Lasting Text" refers to a feature that allows you to display text throughout your entire video clip, or for a significant portion of it, without manually adjusting the duration. 
- It's essentially a shortcut to avoid having to stretch the text box all the way to the end of the video timeline.

**Benefits of Lasting Text:**

**Convenience:** Saves you time compared to manually dragging the text box on the timeline to match the video length.
**Consistency:** Ensures your text remains visible throughout the video without the risk of accidentally shortening it during editing.
**Watermarking:** Useful for adding permanent text overlays like watermarks or credits that appear throughout your video.

   - You can rotate the video clip or image to any angle. This can add dynamic movement to your video or help align elements that are not perfectly horizontal or vertical.

2. **Mirror**
- The mirror options in the transform feature of CapCut allow users to flip their video clips or images either horizontally or vertically. This can be useful correcting the orientation of footage, or adding creative variations to your videos.

3. **Resize:**
   - The scale function allows you to resize the video clip or image. You can make it larger or smaller to fit your desired layout. This is particularly useful for zooming in on specific details or creating picture-in-picture effects.

### Practical Applications of the Transform Feature

- **Reframing Shots:** If your original footage wasn't framed perfectly, you can use the position and scale functions to adjust the composition.
- **Dynamic Movement:** By keyframing transformations (position, scale, rotation), you can create animations and movements within your video. For example, you can simulate a camera pan or zoom.

### Auto reframe

The auto reframe feature in CapCut is a time-saving tool that helps you adjust your video's aspect ratio automatically. It's particularly useful for adapting videos shot in landscape mode (widescreen) to portrait mode (vertical), which is popular for platforms like TikTok and Instagram Stories.

**Benefits of Using Auto Reframe:**

- **Saves Time:**  Skip the manual cropping and zooming process, letting CapCut handle the resizing efficiently.
- **Optimized for Different Platforms:**  Easily create videos in the perfect aspect ratio for various social media platforms without compromising the content.

### Adjustment

The adjustment feature in CapCut is a powerful tool that allows you to fine-tune the visual appearance of your videos. It essentially acts like a digital toolbox for manipulating various aspects of how your video looks. Here's a breakdown of what the adjustment feature offers:

**Color and Light Controls:**

* **Brightness:** Adjust the overall brightness of your video, making it darker or brighter.
* **Contrast:** Enhance the difference between light and dark areas, creating a more dramatic or defined look.
* **Saturation:** Control the intensity of colors in your video. Increased saturation makes colors more vivid, while decreasing it creates a more muted tone.
* **Sharpen:**  Sharpen the edges in your video, making details appear crisper. 
* **Highlights & Shadows:**  Independently adjust the brightness of highlights (brightest areas) and shadows (darkest areas) for better exposure control.

**Additional Adjustments:**

* **Temperature:**  Shift the overall color temperature of your video, making it appear cooler (bluer) or warmer (redder).
* **Tint:**  Add a subtle color cast to your video, like a greenish or pinkish tint.
* **Exposure:**  Adjust the overall light exposure of your video, similar to adjusting brightness but with more nuanced control.

**Using the Adjustment Feature:**

**This is useful for:**

- Highlighting a specific moment in your video
- Adding emphasis or creating a pause for dramatic effect
- Creating a clone effect by duplicating the frozen frame

## Module 5: Audio & Music**

**Key Learning:**

1. Record
2. Extract Audio
3. Isolate voice
4. Enhance voice
5. Reduce noice
6. Adding Background Music: Set the mood with royalty-free music or your own tunes.

### 1. Record

In CapCut, "Sound recording" refers to the functionality that allows you to record your own voice directly within the app and add it as a narration or commentary track to your vid eo project.  Here's a breakdown of how it works:

**Using Sound Recording in CapCut:**

1. **Access the Recording Feature:** 
   - **Mobile app:** Within the `audio` options, tap on the function labeled `Record` (represented by a microphone icon). 
   - **PC version:** Click on the `Voiceover` (represented by a microphone icon), usually located on the timeline or toolbar. 
2. **Positioning the Playhead:**  It's helpful to position the playhead on the timeline where you want your voiceover to start in the video. This ensures your narration is synchronized with the visuals.
3. **Tap to Record:** Tap the record button once. This might initiate a countdown before recording starts, allowing you to prepare. Tap the button again to stop recording.
4. **Preview and Editing:** Once you've recorded your voiceover, you can preview it by playing back the video. CapCut allows you to edit the recording like any other audio track in your project. You can trim unwanted parts, adjust volume levels, or even add effects like echo or reverb.

**Benefits of Sound Recording in CapCut:**

- **Convenience:**  It eliminates the need for a separate audio recording device. You can narrate and edit your video entirely within CapCut.
- **Synchronization:**  Easily aligning your narration with the visuals is simpler compared to recording externally and then importing the audio track.
- **Multiple Takes:**  If you make a mistake during recording, you can simply re-record that section within CapCut without needing to re-record the entire video.

**Tips:**

- **Device Microphone:** The recording quality will depend on the microphone on your device (phone or tablet). Using an external microphone can improve audio quality if needed.
- **Background Noise:**  Minimizing background noise in your recording environment is recommended for clearer narration.
- **Script or Outline:**  Having a script or outline for your narration can help you stay focused and ensure you cover all the desired points during recording.

### 2. Extract Audio

- The audio extract feature in CapCut is a handy tool that allows you to isolate and save the audio portion from a video clip within your editing project. This extracted audio can then be used for various purposes:

* **Separate Audio Editing:**  Extracting the audio lets you edit it independently from the video. You can trim unwanted parts, adjust volume levels, add effects, or even create a standalone audio file. 
* **Replacing Original Audio:** Perhaps you don't like the original audio in your video clip. You can extract it, remove it from the video, and then replace it with a different audio track like music, sound effects, or your own narration.
* **Creating Audio Overlays:**  If you have a video with existing audio but want to add another audio layer on top (like commentary), extracting audio from another clip can provide that additional audio track. 

Here's how to use the audio extract feature in CapCut:

1. **Import your video clip:** Add the video containing the audio you want to extract to your CapCut project timeline.
2. **Locate the video clip:**  On the timeline, tap on the video clip to select it.
3. **Access the audio extraction options:** There are two main ways to access the extract audio feature depending on your device:
    - **Mobile app:** Tap on the audio track (the waveform) below the video clip. You should see an "Extract audio" option displayed.
    - **PC version:** Right-click on the video clip in the timeline and select "Extract audio" from the context menu.
4. **Extracted audio track:** Once you choose "Extract audio," CapCut will process the video and create a separate audio track containing the extracted audio. This new audio track will appear in your timeline alongside the original video clip.

**Here are some additional things to keep in mind about audio extract:**

* **Original video is muted:**  When you extract the audio, the original video clip itself will be muted. You can choose to keep it in the timeline for reference or delete it if you no longer need the video portion.
* **Extracted audio format:** The extracted audio will be saved in a commonly used audio format like AAC, which is compatible with most devices and editing software.
* **Multiple extractions:** You can extract audio from multiple video clips in your project following the same steps.

### 3. Isolate voice

The "Isolate Voice" feature in CapCut is a relatively new and powerful tool designed to separate vocals from the background music or instrumental tracks in your videos. Here's what it does:

**Function:** It utilizes advanced audio processing algorithms to try and isolate the vocal track from the rest of the audio in your video clip. 

**Benefits:**

* **Karaoke Creation:** Isolate the voice and  the background music to create a karaoke-style version of your video song.
* **Focus on Vocals:** If your video features someone speaking with background music, isolating the voice can make their speech clearer and easier to understand.
* **Creative Remixes:** You can use the isolated vocals to create remixes or mashups by combining them with different backing music. 

**How it Works:**

1. **Import your video:** Add the video containing the audio you want to isolate to your CapCut project.
2. **Access "Isolate Voice":** Locate the audio track (the waveform) below the video clip. You should see an "Edit" or "Adjust" option. Tap on it. 
3. **Choose "Isolate Voice":** Within the audio editing options, you'll find an "Isolate Voice" function (depending on your CapCut version, the wording might be slightly different).
4. **Processing and Results:** CapCut will analyze the audio and attempt to separate the vocals. This processing might take a few seconds depending on the video length.
5. **Two Options:** Once processing is complete, CapCut will present you with two choices:
    - **Keep Vocal:** This keeps the isolated vocals and removes the background music. 
    - **Keep Background Music:** This removes the vocals and keeps the background music (essentially creating an instrumental track).

**Keep in mind:**

* **Accuracy may vary:** The effectiveness of isolating vocals depends on the complexity of the original audio. Clean recordings with clear separation between vocals and music will yield better results. 
* **Not perfect isolation:**  Background noise or instruments with similar frequencies to vocals might be partially removed alongside the vocals. 
* **Limited adjustments:**  CapCut's "Isolate Voice" is a one-click function and doesn't offer advanced controls to fine-tune the separation process. 

**Creating Karaoke Tracks:** This involves taking an existing song and producing a version specifically for karaoke use (Karaoke is a form of interactive entertainment where people sing along to pre-recorded instrumental accompaniments of popular songs, using a microphone). This means removing the lead vocals while keeping the instrumental backing track. This can be done through various methods, like live instrument recording or using MIDI instruments.

### 4. Enhance voice

- In CapCut, "Enhance Voice" is a feature designed to improve the audio quality of your video's voice track. It utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to automatically refine and potentially enhance the voice clarity in your video.

**Benefits of Using Enhance Voice:**

**Improved Clarity:** By reducing background noise and echo, "Enhance Voice" can make your video's dialogue or narration sound clearer and more professional.
**Easier Listening:** A potentially boosted voice volume can improve the listening experience for viewers.

### 5. Reduce noise

- In CapCut, "Reduce Noise" is a feature that helps you improve the audio quality of your videos by specifically targeting and minimizing unwanted background sounds. 
- It utilizes audio processing algorithms to make the main audio content (dialogue, music) stand out.

**Benefits of Reduce Noise in CapCut:**

**Enhanced Clarity:** By reducing background noise like hums, hisses, wind, or traffic sounds, CapCut's "Reduce Noise" helps your video's audio become cleaner and easier to understand.
**Improved Listening Experience:** With less distraction from unwanted sounds, viewers can focus on the dialogue or music in your video, leading to a more enjoyable experience.
**Professional Touch:** Cleaner audio can elevate the overall quality of your CapCut video, making it sound more professional and polished.

## Advance Editing Techniques

### Background

## CapCut Background Feature: Colors, Images, and Blur

The background feature in CapCut allows you to transform the backdrop of your videos, adding creativity and enhancing visual impact. Here's a breakdown of the color, image, and blur options within this feature:

**Background Features in CapCut: Color, Image, and Blur Options**

In CapCut, the background feature offers users versatile options to customize the backdrop of their video clips, enhancing visual appeal and storytelling. This feature includes color, image, and blur options, each serving distinct purposes to elevate the overall presentation. Here's a breakdown of these options:

**1. Color Background:**

- The color background option allows users to select a solid color as the backdrop for their video clips.
- Users can choose from a wide range of colors to match the mood, theme, or branding of their video projects.

**2. Image Background:**

- With the image background option, users can import custom images to serve as the backdrop for their video clips.
- This feature enables users to add depth, context, or visual interest to their videos by incorporating relevant images as backgrounds.

**3. Blur Background:**

- The blur background option applies a blur effect to the backdrop of video clips, drawing focus to the foreground subjects or creating a cinematic aesthetic.
- This feature is particularly useful for removing distractions from the background or achieving a shallow depth of field effect.

### Remove BG

In CapCut, "Remove BG" stands for "Remove Background." It's a tool that helps you remove the background from an image or video clip. This allows you to:

* **Place your subject on a new background:** Once the background is removed, you can add a solid color background, another image, or even another video clip behind your subject. This is useful for creating a cleaner look or placing your subject in a different environment.
* **Focus on the main element:** Removing the background can help draw attention to the main subject of your video, making it stand out more.

When using CapCut's "Remove Background" feature, you can choose from three methods:

**Auto Removal:** This is the quickest option, ideal for videos with a clear subject standing out from the background.
**Custom Removal:** This method gives you more control, allowing you to refine the edges of your subject for a polished look.
**Chroma Key:** This is best suited for videos filmed with a green screen background, allowing for precise removal of the green color.
   
**Background Removal Options in CapCut: Auto Removal vs. Custom Removal vs. Chroma Key:**

CapCut offers three main background removal options: Auto Removal, Custom Removal, and Chroma Key. Each has its strengths and weaknesses depending on your video content:

**1. Auto Removal:**

* **Pros:** This is the simplest and fastest option. It's ideal for videos with a clear distinction between the subject and the background, like someone standing in front of a solid color wall. 
* **Cons:** Auto Removal might not be precise and can remove parts of your subject with complex edges (like hair) or if the background color blends slightly with the subject.  

**2. Custom Removal:**

* **Pros:** This option gives you more control over the background removal process. You can use a brush tool to manually define the areas you want to keep (subject) and remove (background). This allows for a more accurate cut, especially for subjects with intricate details.
* **Cons:**  Custom Removal requires more time and effort compared to Auto Removal. It can be tedious for complex backgrounds or long videos.

**3. Chroma Key:**

* **Pros:**  Chroma Key is best suited for videos filmed specifically with a green screen background. It removes a specific color (usually green) very effectively, leaving your subject transparent for you to place on a new background. 
* **Cons:** Chroma Key requires filming with a green screen (or a similar solid color background) beforehand. This adds an extra setup step compared to using the footage you already have. 

**Here's a quick table to summarize:**

| Feature | Best For | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|---|
| Auto Removal | Simple backgrounds, clear contrast | Fast, easy to use | Might remove parts of the subject |
| Custom Removal | Complex backgrounds, intricate details | Precise control over removal | Time-consuming for complex videos |
| Chroma Key | Green screen footage | Very clean removal of specific color | Requires green screen filming  |

**Choosing the Right Option:**

* If you have a simple video with a clean background, Auto Removal is a good starting point.
* If your video has a complex background or needs a very precise cut, use Custom Removal.
* If you specifically filmed your video with a green screen, Chroma Key is the way to go.

Here's how CapCut's "Remove BG" tool works:

* **For Images / Videos:**  
  1. Import your image into CapCut.
  2. Tap on the image in the timeline.
  3. Look for the menu at the bottom with options like "Adjust," "Filters," etc.  
  4. Select "Remove BG"
  5. Choose Auto removal or Custom removal or Chroma key.

**Keep in mind:**

*  "Remove BG" works best with videos that have a clear contrast between the subject and the background. If the subject and background have similar colors, it might be difficult to achieve a clean removal.
*  The "Auto Cutout" feature is a good starting point, but you might need to refine the edges of the cutout for a more polished look. 
  
### Mask

The mask feature in CapCut is a powerful tool that allows users to apply various effects to specific parts of their video. This can include adding overlays, hiding or revealing parts of the video, or creating custom shapes and patterns to enhance the visual appeal.

CapCut is a popular video editing app that offers a variety of features to enhance video creation. One of these features is the "mask" feature, which allows users to apply different shapes and effects to their video clips, creating interesting visual effects by hiding or revealing parts of the video.

### Mask Feature in CapCut

The mask feature enables users to create custom shapes and effects on their video clips. This can be used to focus on a specific part of the video, create split-screen effects, or add creative overlays. Here's a breakdown of the specific mask options available in CapCut:

1. **Horizontal Mask:**
   - The horizontal mask allows you to create a horizontal split or gradient across your video. You can adjust the position and width of the mask to reveal or hide parts of the video horizontally. This is useful for creating split-screen effects or gradual transitions from one clip to another.

2. **Circle Mask:**
   - The circle mask creates a circular cutout on your video. You can adjust the size and position of the circle to focus on a specific part of the video. This is useful for highlighting subjects or creating a vignette effect (The vignette effect is a technique used in photography and editing to create a darkening of the edges or corners of an image.).

3. **Rectangle Mask:**
   - The rectangle mask allows you to create a rectangular cutout on your video. You can adjust the size, position, and aspect ratio of the rectangle to reveal or hide parts of the video. This is often used for framing subjects or creating split-screen effects.

4. **Heart Mask:**
   - The heart mask creates a heart-shaped cutout on your video. You can adjust the size and position of the heart to highlight specific parts of the video. This is commonly used for romantic or sentimental effects.

5. **Invert Option:**
   - The invert option allows you to invert the selected mask shape. Instead of showing the area inside the mask, it hides the area inside and shows everything outside the mask. This can create unique visual effects by reversing the mask's function.

**What can you do with masking in CapCut?**

- **Creative Effects:** Masks can be used to create artistic and visually appealing effects in your videos. For example, you can use the circle mask to create a spotlight effect on a subject.
- **Transitions:** By animating masks, you can create smooth transitions between different video clips. For instance, a horizontal mask can slide from left to right to reveal the next clip.
- **Emphasis:** Masks can help emphasize specific parts of your video. For example, a heart mask can be used to highlight a couple in a romantic scene.
- **Split-Screen:** Using rectangle or horizontal masks, you can create split-screen effects to show multiple videos simultaneously.

By utilizing these mask options, CapCut users can enhance their video editing capabilities and add a professional touch to their creations.

### Retouch

## CapCut Face Retouch: Unveiling Face, Reshape, and Makeup Options

CapCut's retouch feature allows you to enhance facial features in your videos. Let's delve into the specific functionalities within the "Face," "Reshape," and "Makeup" options:

**I. Face:**

This section focuses on overall skin tone and texture adjustments:

- **Smoothing:** This tool reduces the appearance of wrinkles, fine lines, and blemishes. You can control the intensity for a natural-looking smoothening or a more airbrushed effect. 
- **Skin Tone:** Here, you can even out skin tone and adjust its overall color. This is useful for correcting lighting issues or achieving a specific look, like a light tan.
- **Whiten Teeth:** Brighten teeth for a whiter and more radiant smile in your videos.

**II. Reshape:**

This section allows for subtle adjustments to facial features:

- **Slim Face:** This tool helps to slightly narrow the jawline for a slimmer facial appearance. Use it cautiously to avoid an unnatural look.
- **Enlarge Eyes:** Want to make your eyes appear bigger? This tool allows for subtle enlargement but be mindful of maintaining realistic proportions.
- **Sharpen Nose:** This tool can slightly refine the bridge of the nose. Again, subtlety is key here.

**III. Makeup (Limited):**

While not as extensive as dedicated makeup apps, CapCut offers basic virtual makeup options:

- **Lipstick:** Apply lipstick in various colors to enhance your look. Choose a shade that complements your skin tone and the overall style of your video.
- **Blush:** Add a touch of blush to bring color to your cheeks. Experiment with different shades and intensities to find the perfect look.
- **Eyeshadow:** Apply basic eyeshadow colors to enhance your eyes. While CapCut doesn't offer extensive options, you can still create a simple and stylish look.

**2. Body Retouch:**

* **Smooth:** Similar to the face option, this smooths out skin imperfections on the body, like cellulite or stretch marks. Use it subtly to avoid an unnatural look.
* **Brighten:** This brightens the overall skin tone of the body, making it appear lighter.
* **Slim:** This tool allows you to slim down specific body areas like the waist, legs, or arms. Be careful not to overdo it, as it can distort the natural proportions.

**Here are some general tips for using CapCut's retouch feature:**

* **Start with Subtle Adjustments:**  Always begin with minimal adjustments and gradually increase them until you achieve the desired effect.
* **Focus on Enhancement, Not Alteration:**  The goal is to enhance natural features, not completely change someone's appearance. 
* **Consider Lighting:**  Poor lighting can make retouching more difficult. If possible, try to film in good lighting conditions.
* **Review Before Exporting:**  Always preview your edits before finalizing your video to ensure the retouching looks natural.

- In CapCut, "text behind object" refers to a technique where you make text appear behind an object in your video. 

Achieving a "text behind object" effect in CapCut with overlays involves a two-step process:

**I. Adding the Text:**

  * Start by importing your video clip into CapCut.
  * Tap on the "Text" option and write your desired text.
  * Customize the text using the available options for font, size, color, and animation (if desired).
  * Position the text where you want it to appear behind the object in the video.

**II. Creating the Overlay with Background Removal:**

  There are two main approaches for this step:

    **a) Overlay with a Duplicate Video (Works best for static objects):**
    **b) Overlay with an Image (More flexible for various objects):**

**2. Video in Text:***

- In CapCut, "video in text" refers to a video editing technique where you display a video clip inside the letters of text. This can create a cool visual effect, especially if the video content complements the text.

There isn't a built-in feature for this in CapCut, but you can achieve it with a two-step process:

1. **Create Text with a Green Background:** First, you add text and customize it to fill the screen. Use a solid green color for the background. 

2. **Import Video & Apply Chroma Key:** Then, import your video clip and place it on a new track above the text. Use the Chroma Key effect to remove the green background, essentially making the text transparent and revealing the video underneath. You can further refine the effect by adjusting the Chroma Key intensity and adding a shadow to the text.

### Tracking

- The tracking feature in CapCut is a powerful tool that allows you to automatically attach text, graphics, or effects to a moving object within your video footage. 
- This creates a dynamic and visually interesting effect, keeping those elements glued to the object as it moves throughout the clip.

**Using the Tracking Feature in CapCut:**

1. **Import Your Clip:** Add the video clip containing the object you want to track to your CapCut project timeline.

2. **Select Text/Graphic/Effect:** Choose the element you want to track, such as adding text, an emoji, or a special effect.

3. **Access Tracking:** Tap on the element you added on the timeline. Look for the "Tracking" option (usually an icon with a target symbol) in Editing Tools

4. **Select Object to Track:** A window will appear showing your video clip. Use the bullseye icon to pinpoint the object you want the element to follow.

5. **Refine Tracking (Optional):**  CapCut's AI will automatically track the object. 

6. **Preview and Adjust:** Use the play button in the preview window to see how the tracking works. Make adjustments to the element's position or the tracking path if necessary.
