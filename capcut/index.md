## Interface

**Setting the Stage: The CapCut Workspace**

**1. Timeline:** 
- The timeline in CapCut is the main workspace where you arrange and edit your video project. It's essentially a visual representation of your video's structure and timing. 

**1.1. Displaying and Arranging Clips:**
  - When you import videos, photos, or audio files into your project, you drag and drop them onto the timeline. Each clip appears as a separate block.
  - By dragging and repositioning these clip blocks on the timeline, you determine the order in which they appear in your final video.

**1.2. Editing Clip Length:**
  - The length of each clip block on the timeline reflects the clip's duration.
  - You can adjust the clip's length by dragging its edges on the timeline. Dragging the right edge extends the clip, while dragging the left edge shortens it.

**1.3. Previewing and Playback:**
  - The timeline has a playhead (usually a vertical white line) that indicates the current playback position.
  - By dragging the playhead or using the playback controls, you can preview specific sections of your video project on the screen above the timeline.

**1.4. Multiple Tracks:**
  - The timeline typically has multiple tracks. This allows you to layer different elements of your video project, such as separate video clips, audio tracks, and text overlays.
  - By arranging elements on different tracks, you can control which ones appear on top of each other in the final video.

**1.5. Editing Tools:**
  - The timeline provides access to various editing tools. You can split clips, trim unwanted sections, adjust volume levels of audio tracks, and add transitions between clips.

**2. Editing Tools (Bottom):** This toolbar appears at the bottom of your screen whenever you don't have a clip selected on the timeline. It provides the main editing functions for your entire project.

**3. Preview Window (Center):** You can preview your edits in real-time as you make changes.
  - Use the play/pause button to preview your edits.

## Importing & Project Setup

**Creating a New Project:**

* Tap the "+ New project" button (usually on the main screen) to start a new project.

**Importing Your Media:**

* There are two ways to import your clips:

    1. **The Import Button:** Tap the "Import" button and browse your device's storage to select the photos and videos you want to use.
    2. **Drag & Drop (Desktop Only):** In the editing window, locate your media files in your device's file manager and drag them directly onto the CapCut editing window.

### Trimming & Splitting

Trimming and splitting in CapCut are two different ways to shorten or edit your video clips:

**Trimming:** This allows you to remove unwanted sections from the beginning or end of a clip. Imagine cutting off the "excess fat" at the edges.

**Splitting:** This cuts your clip into two separate clips at a specific point. 

**Uses for Trimming and Splitting:**

* **Removing unwanted sections:** Cut out mistakes, pauses, or irrelevant parts of your video.
* **Creating a faster-paced video:** Trim off unnecessary silence or slow moments to create a more dynamic video.
* **Creating multiple clips:** Split a long clip into smaller sections for easier editing or rearranging them in a different order.

**Trimming:**

1. **Select the clip** you want to trim in the timeline.
2. **Drag the white handles** at the beginning or end of the clip to shorten it.
    * Drag the left handle to remove the beginning.
    * Drag the right handle to remove the ending.

**Splitting (Mobile App):**

1. **Select the clip** you want to split. 
2. **Tap the "Split" icon** (scissors symbol) on the toolbar. 

Now you have two separate clips!

**How to split and remove an unwanted video (Mobile App)**

**Step 1: Import your video**

* Launch CapCut and tap the "+" button to start a new project.
* Import your video into the editing window.

**Step 2: Locate the unwanted section**

* Play the video in the preview window and identify the part you want to remove.

**Step 3: Split the clip (at the beginning of the unwanted section)**

* Tap on the video clip in the timeline to select it.
* Move the playhead to the exact point where the unwanted section starts.
* Tap the "Split" icon (scissors symbol) on the toolbar 

**Step 4: Split the clip again (at the end of the unwanted section)**

* Now you have two clips. Select the clip containing the unwanted section.
* Move the playhead to the exact point where the unwanted section ends.
* Tap "Split" again to create three separate clips.

**Step 5: Delete the unwanted section**

* Select the unwanted clip in the middle (the one you want to remove).
* Tap the **Delete** icon on the toolbar.

**Class Activity:**

1. **Import your video clip** into a new CapCut project.
2. **Trimming Time!** Identify any unnecessary sections at the beginning or end of your clip. 
    - **Task A:** Trim 3 seconds from the beginning of your clip. 
    - **Task B:** Trim any awkward pauses or silent moments at the end of your clip until the video cuts to the action.

3. **Splitting Scene!** Find a place in your clip where the action changes or a new scene begins. 
    - **Task A:** Split the clip at this point to create two separate clips.
    - **Task B:** Combine trimming and splitting to create a completely different narrative from your original clip.
    - **Task C:** Reverse Reel: Split your clip into small sections and then rearrange them in reverse order to create a unique rewind effect.
