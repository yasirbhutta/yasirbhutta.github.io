## Exercises

- Write a function `sum3(num1,num3,num3)` that takes three numbers as input and returns the sum.
- Write a function `SumNum(num1)` that takes a number as input and returns the sum of numbers from 1 to that number (num1).
- Write a function `sumSquares(x)` that takes a vector of numbers as input and returns the sum of their squares.
- Write a function `isEven(x)` that takes a number as input and returns true if it is even, and false otherwise.
- Write a program with three functions:
  
  1. **`isEven(n)`:** This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` is even and `False` otherwise. You can use the modulo operator (`%`) to check for evenness.
  2. **`printTable(n)`:** This function takes an integer `n` as input and prints its multiplication table. The table should show the product of `n` with each number from 1 to 10, formatted like `n * i = n * i`, where `i` is the current number in the loop.
  3. **`main`:** The main program should:
     - Prompt the user to enter an integer.
     - Use the `isEven(n)` function to check if the entered number is even.
     - If the number is even, call the `printTable(n)` function to print its multiplication table.
     - If the number is odd, print a message indicating the number is odd and not eligible for printing a table.

**Example output:**

```matlab
Enter an integer: 4
4 is even! Here's its multiplication table:
4 * 1 = 4
4 * 2 = 8
4 * 3 = 12
...
4 * 10 = 40
```

- Write a function `avgPositive(data)` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the average of all positive numbers in the list.
