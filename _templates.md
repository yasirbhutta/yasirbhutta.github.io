Images

Sizes
small: 256 width
large: 512 width

In IEEE style, in-text citations for images are typically referenced by the citation number within square brackets. Hereâ€™s how to handle it in text:

1. **In the Text:**
   - Mention the image and include the citation number in brackets. 
   - Example:  
     "The Amazon rainforest has seen a significant reduction in forest cover in recent years (see Fig. 1) [1]."

2. **With the Image (Caption and Citation):**
   - For the image itself, label it as a figure and add a brief description.  
   - Below the figure, include the in-text citation number in brackets, referencing the source.
   - Format:  
     - **Fig. #.** Description of the image [#].

   **Example**:
   ```markdown
   **Fig. 1.** Satellite image showing deforestation patterns in the Amazon rainforest [1].
   ```

### Full Example (In the Text + With the Image):
In the body of your document:
> "The decline of forest cover is evident from recent satellite imagery (see Fig. 1) [1]."

With the image:
```markdown
![Amazon rainforest deforestation](image_url)
**Fig. 1.** Satellite image showing deforestation patterns in the Amazon rainforest [1].
```

Be sure that the number in brackets corresponds with the full citation in your references list, formatted as shown previously.
