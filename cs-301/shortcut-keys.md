## SHORTCUT KEYS

SHORTCUT KEYS ABCs
Shortcut keys help provide an easier and usually quicker method of navigating and using computer software programs. Shortcut keys are commonly accessed by using the Alt, Ctrl, and/or Shift in conjunction with a single letter. The de facto standard for listing a shortcut is listing the modifier key, a plus symbol, and the single character. Or in other words, "ALT+S" is telling you to press the Alt key and while continuing to hold the Alt key, press the S key to perform the shortcut. 
In addition to the shortcuts listed on this page, users can find the shortcut keys to their most popular program by looking for underlined letters in their menus. For example, in the below picture, you can notice that the "F" in File has been underlined. Users can know by looking at this that they can press the Alt key and F to access the File menu. Finally, also seen in the below picture, you may notice that some of the common features such as Open and Save have shortcut keys assigned to them. In the below example, pressing Ctrl+O would perform the open for the program.
 
As you begin to work with shortcut keys you will notice that several applications share the same shortcut keys. We have listed many of these keys in our basic shortcut keys section.
