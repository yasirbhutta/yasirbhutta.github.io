## Introduction

## Data Input

### What is variable

- A variable in programming language is a named storage location in computer memory.
- It is used to store data that can be changed during the course of program execution.
- Variables can be used to store any type of data, such as numbers, text, dates, and objects.

### Assignment Statement and Variable Declaration

## Interactive Inputs

### Input Functions

#### Example 1

Write a MATLAB script to take input two numbers from users and output the sum of those numbers.

```matlab
% Prompt the user for two numbers
num1 = input('Enter the first number: ');
num2 = input('Enter the second number: ');

% Calculate the sum of the two numbers
sum = num1 + num2;

% Output the sum to the user
disp(sum)
```

#### Example 2

Write a MATLAB script to take input name and age from users and display the name and age.

```matlab
% Prompt the user for their name and age
name = input('Enter your name: ', 's');
age = input('Enter your age: ');

% Display the name and age to the user
disp('Output of the code')
disp(name)
disp(age)
```

### Keyboard Command

#### Syntax

```matlab
keyboard
```

- keyboard pauses execution of a running program and gives control to the keyboard.
- Place the keyboard function in a program at the location where you want MATLABÂ® to pause.
- When the program pauses, the prompt in the Command Window changes to K>>, indicating that MATLAB is in debug mode.
- You then can view or change the values of variables to see if the new values produce expected results.

>**Tips**

- To terminate debug mode and continue execution, use the dbcont command.
- To terminate debug mode and exit the file without completing execution, use the dbquit command.

#### Example 3

```matlab
% Perform some calculations
a = 5;
b = 10;
c = a + b;
    
% Pause execution and enter debugging mode
keyboard

% Continue with more calculations
d = c * 2;
    
% Return the result
result = d;

disp(result)
```

### Pause Command

#### Syntax 

```matlab
pause(n)
```

- In MATLAB, the `pause` keyword is used to pause the execution of a script or function for a specified amount of time. 
- It can be useful in various situations, such as creating delays in animations, giving users time to read messages, or controlling the timing of certain operations.

#### Example 4

```matlab
a = 5;
b = 10;

c = a+b;
disp('Sum');
disp(c);

pause(2)

disp('Product');
result = a * b;
disp(result);

pause(2)

result = b/a;
disp('Divide');
disp(result);

```

## Reading/Storing File Data

## **Review Questions**

### Write note on Common Ways to Input Data in MATLAB?

### What is a variable in computer programming?

>**Answer:** A variable is a named storage location in a computer's memory that is used to hold data or values. It allows programmers to store and manipulate data within a program.

### What is the purpose of using variables in programming?

>**Answer:** Variables provide a way to store and manage data that can be used and manipulated throughout a program. They make programs more flexible and allow for dynamic data storage.

#### What is the difference between declaring and initializing a variable?

>**Answer:** Declaring a variable involves specifying its name and data type, while initializing a variable means giving it an initial value. Initialization usually follows declaration but is not always required.

### In MATLAB, what happens if you try to access a variable that has not been declared or initialized?

>**Answer:** In MATLAB, trying to access an undeclared or uninitialized variable typically results in an error. MATLAB will display a message indicating that the variable is undefined.

### What is a data type in MATLAB, and why is it important?

>**Answer:** A data type in MATLAB defines the kind of values a variable can hold and how those values are stored and manipulated. It's important because it affects memory usage, performance, and the operations that can be performed on the data.

### How do you assign a new value to an existing variable in MATLAB?

>**Answer:** In MATLAB, you can assign a new value to an existing variable simply by using the variable name followed by the new value. For example, x = 10; assigns the value 10 to the variable x.

### What is an assignment statement in MATLAB, and what is its primary purpose?

>**Answer:** An assignment statement in MATLAB is used to assign a value to a variable. Its primary purpose is to store and manage data within a program.

### Explain the difference between the = operator and the == operator in MATLAB.

>**Answer:** The = operator is used for assignment, setting the value of a variable. The == operator is used for comparison and checks if two values are equal.

### What is the purpose of the clear command in MATLAB, and how does it relate to variable declaration?

>**Answer:** The clear command in MATLAB is used to remove variables from the workspace. It's related to variable declaration because it allows you to clean up the workspace and remove unused variables, which can help manage memory effectively.

#### What is the purpose of the keyboard keyword in MATLAB, and how is it used in a script or function?

#### What are some common use cases for using the pause keyword in MATLAB scripts or functions?

#### Can you provide an example of using the pause function to create a timed delay in a MATLAB script?
