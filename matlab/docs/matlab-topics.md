34. emperature Converter: Develop a MATLAB program that converts temperature between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales based on user input.
35. BMI Calculator: Build a MATLAB script that calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input of weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters), and provides a classification of underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.
36. Data Visualization: Use MATLAB to visualize data from a CSV file, such as temperature or stock market data, by plotting time-series graphs and analyzing trends.
37. Control Flow Statements in MATLAB
38. Function Visualizer: Create a program that prompts the user to enter a mathematical function (e.g., sin(x), x^2 + 2x) and plots the function over a specified range. This reinforces understanding of function behavior and visualization techniques.
39. Prime Number Checker: Write a program that takes a number as input and determines whether it's prime. Utilize for loops and conditional statements to check for divisibility by smaller numbers. This project practices loop logic and basic number theory.
40. Interactive Calculus: Develop a program that allows users to input a function and choose between finding its derivative or integral. The program should then calculate and display the result. This exercise combines mathematical concepts with MATLAB's symbolic computation capabilities.
41. Coin Flip Simulator: Simulate coin flips (or dice rolls) for a specified number of trials. Calculate and display the probability of heads (or specific dice outcomes) and visualize the results using a bar chart. This project introduces concepts like random number generation and data visualization.
42. Stock Market Analysis (Basic): Download a sample dataset of historical stock prices ([available online](https://datahub.io/collections/stock-market-data)) and calculate basic statistics like mean, standard deviation, or minimum/maximum values. Optionally, plot the price trend over time to explore basic data analysis techniques.
43. Budget Tracker: Design a program that allows users to input their income and expenses for different categories. Calculate the total expenditure and remaining balance. This project practices user input, calculations, and potentially formatting output for readability.
