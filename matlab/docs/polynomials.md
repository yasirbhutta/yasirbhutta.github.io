**Polynomial:** A polynomial is an expression consisting of variables (usually denoted by x) raised to non-negative integer powers (like x^2, x^3, etc.), combined with coefficients (numerical values) using addition, subtraction, and multiplication.

## 4.6 Polynomial Multiplication

**Example:** Multiply 2x^2 Ã— 3x

```matlab
x = [2 0 0];
y = [3 0];

z = conv(x,y);
disp(z);
```

**Output:**
```
6     0     0     0
```

The polynomial is **6x^3**

## 4.9 Characteristic polynomial of a matrix

The characteristic polynomial, in linear algebra, is a polynomial associated with a square matrix. It has several key properties:

**Eigenvalue Relationship:** The eigenvalues of the matrix are the values that make the characteristic polynomial equal to zero. In other words, the roots of the polynomial correspond to the eigenvalues.
**Degree and Size:** The characteristic polynomial is a polynomial of degree n, where n is the dimension of the square matrix. This implies that an n x n matrix can have at most n distinct eigenvalues.

## 4.11 Polynomial Integration

**Polynomial:** A polynomial is an expression consisting of variables (usually denoted by x) raised to non-negative integer powers (like x^2, x^3, etc.), combined with coefficients (numerical values) using addition, subtraction, and multiplication.

**Derivative:** In calculus, the derivative of a function represents the instantaneous rate of change of that function at a specific point. For polynomials, it tells you how fast the polynomial's value changes as its input (x) changes.
