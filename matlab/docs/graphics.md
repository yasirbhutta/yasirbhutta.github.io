### 2D Plots

#### Printing Labels

The xlabel() and ylabel() functions are used to label the x and y axes in a figure in MATLAB. The labels should describe the data that is being plotted on each axis.

The title() function is used to add a title to a figure in MATLAB. The title should provide a brief description of the plot.

Example 3: Label the axes and add a title

```matlab
x = linspace(0, 10, 100);
y = sin(x);

plot(x, y);
xlabel('X-axis');
ylabel('Y-axis');
title('Sine Wave');
```

#### Grid and Axex Box

The grid() function is used to add grid lines to a figure in MATLAB. Grid lines can help to make it easier to interpret the data in a plot.

#### Entering Text in a Plot

#### Axis Control

he axis() function is used to set the limits of the axes in a figure in MATLAB. The axes are the horizontal and vertical lines that extend across the figure window.

#### Axis Aspect Ration

### Multiple Plots

#### Using plot Command

The plot() function is used to create a line plot in MATLAB. A line plot is a graphical representation of a set of data points connected by a line.

#### Using hold Command

The hold function is used to prevent MATLAB from overwriting existing plots when creating new ones. By default, MATLAB overwrites existing plots when creating new ones. However, if you use the hold function before creating a new plot, MATLAB will add the new plot to the existing plot instead of overwriting it.

Example 2: Plotting multiple lines on the same graph

```matlab
x = linspace(0, 10, 100);
y1 = sin(x);
y2 = cos(x);

plot(x, y1, 'b');
hold on;
plot(x, y2, 'r');
hold off;
```

This will plot two lines on the same graph, one blue and one red. The hold on and hold off functions are used to prevent the second line from overwriting the first line.

#### Using line Command

### Style Options

#### Example

```matlab
x = 1:1:10;

y1 = sqrt(x.^2+1);
y2 = 2 * x + 20;
y3 = 3 * x + 3;

plot(x,y1,'r*:');
line(x,y2);
line(x,y3);
```

#### Example: Plotting Two Functions on the Same Graph in MATLAB

```matlab
x = 1:1:10;

y1 = sqrt(x.^2+1);
y2 = 2 * x + 20;


plot(x, y1, 'r', x, y2, 'bo');
axis([0 12 0 45]);
```

### LEGEND

The legend() function is used to create a legend for a figure in MATLAB. A legend is a key that explains which line or curve corresponds to which data set.

### Example

```matlab
% Real world data example
% Global average temperature data from NASA
% https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs/

% Load the data
data = load('global_average_temperature.csv');

% Extract the years and temperatures
years = data(:, 1);
temperatures = data(:, 2);

% Create a line plot of the data
figure;
plot(years, temperatures);

% Add a legend
legend('Global average temperature');

% Set the axis labels and title
xlabel('Year');
ylabel('Temperature (Â°C)');
title('Global Average Temperature from 1880 to 2022');
```

### SUBPLOTS

#### Example: Visualizing Daily Temperature Data with Subplots in MATLAB

Download dataset `Daily Temperature (Dataset #2)` from [Datasets](../../datasets/index.md).

```matlab
% Specify the name of the CSV file
filename = 'ds2.csv';

% Read the data from the CSV file into a table variable
data = readtable(filename,'VariableNamingRule','preserve'); 

% Create the first subplot
subplot(1, 2, 1);
plot(data.dated, data.temperature);
title('Daily Temperatures');
xlabel('Date');
ylabel('Temperature (C)');

% Create the second subplot
subplot(1, 2, 2);
histogram(data.temperature);
title('Temperature Distribution');
xlabel('Temperature (C)');
ylabel('Frequency');

% Save the figure
saveas(gcf, 'daily_temperatures.png');
```

### Specialized 2D plots

#### Logarithmic Plot Functions

#### polar

#### area

#### bar

Example 3: Plotting a bar graph

```matlab
x = categorical({'A', 'B', 'C'});
y = [10, 20, 30];

bar(x, y);
```

**Categorical Arrary:** categorical is a data type to store data with values from a finite set of discrete categories. For example, the syntax C = categorical({'R','G','B','B','G','B'}) creates a categorical array with six elements that belong to the categories R, G, or B.[^1]

Download dataset `Population by Country` from [Datasets](../../datasets/index.md).

##### Example: Population Distribution by Country using bar charts

```matlab
% Specify the name of the CSV file
filename = 'ds1.csv';

% Read the data from the CSV file into a table variable
data = readtable(filename,'VariableNamingRule','preserve'); 

% Convert the Country column to a categorical variable
x = categorical(data.Country);

% Generate a bar plot of the population data
bar(x,data.Population);

% Add a title and axis labels to the plot
title('Population by Country');
xlabel('Country');
ylabel('Population');

```

histogram(x);
```

#### rose

#### pie

Example 5: Plotting a pie chart

```matlab
X = [10 20 30];

pie(X);
```

This will plot a pie chart with three slices, one for each value in the vector X. The size of each slice represents the proportion of that value to the total.

#### Example: Visualizing Fruit Sales Distribution with Exploded Pie Chart

```matlab
% Define the fruit names and sales figures
fruit_names = ["Apples", "Oranges", "Bananas", "Grapes", "Strawberries"];
sales_figures = [120, 90, 150, 80, 60];

% Define the explode vector to offset the "Bananas" slice
explode = [0 0 1 0 0];

% Create the pie chart and label the slices
pie(sales_figures, explode, fruit_names);

% Set the title of the pie chart
title('Fruit Sales Pie Chart');
```

### 3D Plots

#### plot3

##### Example: Create 3-D Bar Graph from Vector Data

```matlab
% Create a vector of values to plot.
z = [50 40 30 20 10];

% Plot the 3-D bar graph.
bar3(z);

% Set the axes labels.
xlabel('X Axis');
ylabel('Y Axis');
zlabel('Z Axis');

% Set the title.
title('My 3-D Bar Graph');

y = 1:10;
plot(x, y, 'Color', 'red');
```

- How do you add a `title` to a figure in MATLAB?

Answer:

To add a title to a figure in MATLAB, you can use the title() function. For example, the following command will add the title "My Line Plot" to the figure:

y = 1:10;
plot(x, y);
xlabel('X-Axis');
ylabel('Y-Axis');
```

- How do you add a grid to a figure in MATLAB

**Answer:**

To add a grid to a figure in MATLAB, you can use the grid() function. For example, the following command will add a grid to the figure:

```matlab
x = 1:10;
y = 1:10;
plot(x, y);
grid on;
```

- What is the difference between a 2D and 3D plot in MATLAB?

**Answer:**

A 2D plot is used to visualize data that has two dimensions, such as height and weight. A 3D plot is used to visualize data that has three dimensions, such as height, weight, and depth.
