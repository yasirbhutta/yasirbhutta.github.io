## 2D Plots

### Printing Labels

The xlabel() and ylabel() functions are used to label the x and y axes in a figure in MATLAB. The labels should describe the data that is being plotted on each axis.

The title() function is used to add a title to a figure in MATLAB. The title should provide a brief description of the plot.

**Example #:** Label the axes and add a title

```matlab
x = linspace(0, 10, 100);
y = sin(x);

plot(x, y);
xlabel('X-axis');
ylabel('Y-axis');
title('Sine Wave');
```

### Grid and Axex Box

The grid() function is used to add grid lines to a figure in MATLAB. Grid lines can help to make it easier to interpret the data in a plot.

### Entering Text in a Plot

**Example #:**

```matlab
years = [1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, 2020];
co2_emissions = [26.17, 26.61, 26.89, 27.46, 28.12, 29.08, 29.94]; 

plot(years,co2_emissions,"ro-");

title("Global CO2 Emissions from 1990 to 2020.");
xlabel("Years");
ylabel("CO2 Emissions (Billion metric tons per year");

grid on;
box off;

```

### Axis Control

he axis() function is used to set the limits of the axes in a figure in MATLAB. The axes are the horizontal and vertical lines that extend across the figure window.

### Axis Aspect Ration

### Multiple Plots

### Using plot Command

The plot() function is used to create a line plot in MATLAB. A line plot is a graphical representation of a set of data points connected by a line.

### Using hold Command

The hold function is used to prevent MATLAB from overwriting existing plots when creating new ones. By default, MATLAB overwrites existing plots when creating new ones. However, if you use the hold function before creating a new plot, MATLAB will add the new plot to the existing plot instead of overwriting it.

**Example #** Plotting multiple lines on the same graph

```matlab
x = linspace(0, 10, 100);
y1 = sin(x);
y2 = cos(x);

plot(x, y1, 'b');
hold on;
plot(x, y2, 'r');
hold off;
```

This will plot two lines on the same graph, one blue and one red. The hold on and hold off functions are used to prevent the second line from overwriting the first line.

### Using line Command

### Style Options

**Example #1:**

```matlab
x = 1:1:10;

y1 = sqrt(x.^2+1);
y2 = 2 * x + 20;
y3 = 3 * x + 3;

plot(x,y1,'r*:');
line(x,y2);
line(x,y3);
```

**Example #2:** Plotting Two Functions on the Same Graph in MATLAB

```matlab
x = 1:1:10;

y1 = sqrt(x.^2+1);
y2 = 2 * x + 20;


plot(x, y1, 'r', x, y2, 'bo');
axis([0 12 0 45]);
```

### LEGEND

The legend() function is used to create a legend for a figure in MATLAB. A legend is a key that explains which line or curve corresponds to which data set.

**Example #1:**

```matlab
% Real world data example
% Global average temperature data from NASA
% https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs/

% Load the data
data = load('global_average_temperature.csv');

% Extract the years and temperatures
years = data(:, 1);
temperatures = data(:, 2);

% Create a line plot of the data
figure;
plot(years, temperatures);

% Add a legend
legend('Global average temperature');

% Set the axis labels and title
xlabel('Year');
ylabel('Temperature (Â°C)');
title('Global Average Temperature from 1880 to 2022');
```

### SUBPLOTS

**Example #1:** Visualizing Daily Temperature Data with Subplots in MATLAB

Download dataset `Daily Temperature (Dataset #2)` from [Datasets](../../datasets/index.md).

```matlab
% Specify the name of the CSV file
filename = 'ds2.csv';

% Read the data from the CSV file into a table variable
data = readtable(filename,'VariableNamingRule','preserve'); 

% Create the first subplot
subplot(1, 2, 1);
plot(data.dated, data.temperature);
title('Daily Temperatures');
xlabel('Date');
ylabel('Temperature (C)');

% Create the second subplot
subplot(1, 2, 2);
histogram(data.temperature);
title('Temperature Distribution');
xlabel('Temperature (C)');
ylabel('Frequency');

% Save the figure
saveas(gcf, 'daily_temperatures.png');
```

### area

### bar

**Example #1:** Plotting a bar graph

```matlab
x = categorical({'A', 'B', 'C'});
y = [10, 20, 30];

bar(x, y);
```

**Categorical Arrary:** categorical is a data type to store data with values from a finite set of discrete categories. For example, the syntax C = categorical({'R','G','B','B','G','B'}) creates a categorical array with six elements that belong to the categories R, G, or B.[^1]

Download dataset `Population by Country` from [Datasets](../../datasets/index.md).

**Example #2:** Population Distribution by Country using bar charts

```matlab
% Specify the name of the CSV file
filename = 'ds1.csv';

% Read the data from the CSV file into a table variable
data = readtable(filename,'VariableNamingRule','preserve'); 

% Convert the Country column to a categorical variable
x = categorical(data.Country);

% Generate a bar plot of the population data
bar(x,data.Population);

% Add a title and axis labels to the plot
title('Population by Country');
xlabel('Country');
ylabel('Population');
```

### histogram

A histogram is a data visualization tool that shows the frequency distribution of numerical data. It is a type of bar graph that displays the number of data points that fall within each of a series of intervals called bins. The bins are usually specified as consecutive, non-overlapping intervals of a variable. The height of each bar in the histogram represents the number of data points that fall within that bin.
![Image of Histogram graph](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/edu/power-pouvoir/c-g/c-g05-7-1-eng.png)

Image Source: [https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/edu/power-pouvoir/ch9/histo/5214822-eng.htm](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/edu/power-pouvoir/ch9/histo/5214822-eng.htm)

Histograms are useful for visualizing the distribution of data, such as the distribution of heights of students in a class, the distribution of test scores, or the distribution of the time it takes to complete a task. They can also be used to compare the distributions of two or more datasets.

Here are some of the key features of a histogram:

- The bins are evenly spaced on the horizontal axis.
- The height of each bar is proportional to the number of data points in the corresponding bin.
- The total area of all the bars is equal to the total number of data points.
- The histogram does not show the individual data points.

**Example #1:** Plotting a histogram

```matlab
x = randn(1000, 1);
histogram(x);
```

### rose

### pie

**Example #:1** Plotting a pie chart

```matlab
X = [10 20 30];

pie(X);
```

This will plot a pie chart with three slices, one for each value in the vector X. The size of each slice represents the proportion of that value to the total.

**Example #2** Visualizing Fruit Sales Distribution with Exploded Pie Chart

```matlab
% Define the fruit names and sales figures
fruit_names = ["Apples", "Oranges", "Bananas", "Grapes", "Strawberries"];
sales_figures = [120, 90, 150, 80, 60];

% Define the explode vector to offset the "Bananas" slice
explode = [0 0 1 0 0];

% Create the pie chart and label the slices
pie(sales_figures, explode, fruit_names);

% Set the title of the pie chart
title('Fruit Sales Pie Chart');
```

### meshgrid

In MATLAB, the meshgrid function is used `to create two matrices from two vectors`. Each element of the first matrix represents one value from the first vector, and each element of the second matrix represents one value from the second vector. This is useful for `creating grids of data points`, which can then be used for plotting or other calculations.

**Example #1:**

```matlab
x = linspace(1,3,3);
y = linspace(2,10,5);
[X,Y] = meshgrid(x,y);
disp(X);
disp(Y);
```

**Explanation:**

1. linspace(1,3,3): This line creates a vector x with 3 equally spaced elements between 1 and 3 (inclusive). So, x = [1 2 3].
2. linspace(2,10,5): This line creates a vector y with 5 equally spaced elements between 2 and 10 (inclusive). So, y = [2 4 6 8 10].
3. [X,Y] = meshgrid(x,y): This line uses the meshgrid function to create two matrices X and Y from the vectors x and y.
   - Each element of X is a copy of the vector x. The number of rows in X is equal to the length of y (5), and the number of columns in X is equal to the length of x (3).
   - Each element of Y is a copy of the vector y. The number of rows in Y is equal to the length of y (5), and the number of columns in Y is equal to the length of x (3).

**Output:**

```output
X =

   1   2   3
   1   2   3
   1   2   3
   1   2   3
   1   2   3

Y =

   2   2   2
   4   4   4
   6   6   6
   8   8   8
  10  10  10
```

**Application of meshgrid:**

- Plotting surfaces: mesh(X,Y,Z) where Z is a function of X and Y

Calculus: In calculus, particularly in multivariable calculus, the concept of a surface is used when dealing with functions of two variables. The graph of a function of two variables (such as z = f(x, y)) can be thought of as a surface in three-dimensional space.

### mesh

**Example #1:**

```matlab
x = -3:0.1:3;
y = x;
[X,Y] = meshgrid(x);

F = X.^2 + Y.^3;
mesh(X,Y,F);
```

**Example #2:**

```matlab
x = linspace(0,10,20);
y = linspace(-5,5,30);

[X,Y] = meshgrid(x,y);

% Example function: Z = sin(x)*cos(y)
Z = sin(X).*cos(Y);

% Plot the mesh using the generated X, Y, and Z matrices
mesh(X, Y, Z);

% Customize the plot with labels, title, and colormap
xlabel('X');
ylabel('Y');
zlabel('Z');
title('Mesh Plot of sin(x)*cos(y)');
colormap('jet');
```
**colormap('jet'):** Set the colormap to 'jet' for a visually appealing gradient.

**Example #3:** Plot quadric surface with the equation yz=1

```matlab

% Define the grid
[x, y] = meshgrid(-10:0.1:10, -10:0.1:10);

% Define the height of the surface
z = 1./y;

% Create the surface plot
mesh(x, y, z);

% Set axis labels
xlabel('X-axis');
ylabel('Y-axis');
zlabel('Z-axis');

% Set the view for better visualization
view(45, 30);

% Title of the plot
title('Quadric Surface: yz = 1');

% Set color map
colormap("cool");

% Display a colorbar
colorbar;

```

```

**Example #7:** 3D Cone Using surf and meshgrid

This method involves creating two matrices, one for the radius of the cone at different heights and another for the angle. Then, you use meshgrid to combine these matrices into 3D grids and use surf to plot the surface.

```matlab
r = linspace(0, 1, 50);
th = linspace(0, 2*pi, 50);
[theta,z] = meshgrid(th,r);
radius = 1 - z;
x = radius .* cos(theta);
y = radius .* sin(theta);

surf(x, y, z);

title("3D cones");
xlabel("x axis");
ylabel("y axis");
zlabel("z axis")
```

```

## Plotting a cylinder

```matlab
% Define the cylinder parameters
[X, Y, Z] = cylinder(50, 20);

% Create surface plot
surf(X, Y, Z);
```

This code will create a cylinder with a height of 20 and a radius of 50. The cylinder function generates a 3D array of points that represent the surface of the cylinder. The surf function then plots the surface using these points.

The line function is used to create a line plot in MATLAB. The syntax for the line function is as follows:

```matlab
line(x, y)
```

where x is a vector of x-coordinates and y is a vector of y-coordinates.

- How do you plot a line in MATLAB using `plot` function?

**Answer:**

To plot a line in MATLAB, you can use the plot() function. The plot() function takes two vectors as arguments: the x-values and the y-values. For example, the following command will plot a line with x-values from 1 to 10 and y-values from 1 to 10:

```matlab
x = 1:10;
y = 1:10;
plot(x, y);
```

- How do you change the color of a line in MATLAB?

**Answer:**

To change the color of a line in MATLAB, you can use the Color property. For example, the following command will change the color of the line to red:

```matlab
x = 1:10;
y = 1:10;
plot(x, y, 'Color', 'red');
```

- How do you add a `title` to a figure in MATLAB?

Answer:

To add a title to a figure in MATLAB, you can use the title() function. For example, the following command will add the title "My Line Plot" to the figure:

```matlab
x = 1:10;
y = 1:10;
plot(x, y);
title('My Line Plot');
```

- How do you add labels to the axes in a figure in MATLAB?

**Answer:**

To add labels to the axes in a figure in MATLAB, you can use the xlabel() and ylabel() functions. For example, the following commands will add the labels "X-Axis" and "Y-Axis" to the x-axis and y-axis, respectively:

```matlab
x = 1:10;
y = 1:10;
plot(x, y);
xlabel('X-Axis');
ylabel('Y-Axis');
```

- How do you add a grid to a figure in MATLAB

**Answer:**

To add a grid to a figure in MATLAB, you can use the grid() function. For example, the following command will add a grid to the figure:

```matlab
x = 1:10;
y = 1:10;
plot(x, y);
grid on;
```

- What is the difference between a 2D and 3D plot in MATLAB?

**Answer:**

A 2D plot is used to visualize data that has two dimensions, such as height and weight. A 3D plot is used to visualize data that has three dimensions, such as height, weight, and depth.
