# MATLAB: Vectors and Matrices


## Vector Products

**Important:** To perform matrix multiplication, the first matrix must have the same number of columns as the second matrix has rows. The number of rows of the resulting matrix equals the number of rows of the first matrix, and the number of columns of the resulting matrix equals the number of columns of the second matrix. [1]


**Important:** In MATLAB, the concept of conjugate refers to the complex conjugate of a number or element within a matrix. The complex conjugate of a complex number is a new number with the same real part but the imaginary part negated.
