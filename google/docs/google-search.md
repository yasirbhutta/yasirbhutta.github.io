[https://www.google.com/](https://www.google.com/)

### Tip 1: Start with the basics

- No matter what you're looking for, start with a simple search like **where's the closest airport?**. You can always add a few descriptive words if necessary.

### Tip 2: Search using your voice

- To search with your voice, say **"Ok Google"** or **select the Microphone**

### Tip 3: Choose words carefully

- When you're deciding what words to put in the search box, try to choose words that are likely to appear on the site you're looking for.
- **For example,** instead of saying **my head hurts**, say **headache**, because that’s the word a medical site would use.

### Tip 4: Don’t worry about the little things

- Spelling: Google's spell checker automatically uses the most common spelling of a given word, whether or not you spell it correctly.
