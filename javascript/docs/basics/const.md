## 🧠 What is `const` in JavaScript?

`const` is a way to **create a variable** in JavaScript, but one that **cannot be changed later**.  
It stands for **"constant"** — something that stays the same.

---

## 📌 Basic Rule

Once you give a value to a `const` variable, you **cannot change** that value.

---

## 🧾 Syntax

```javascript
const name = "John";
```

---

## ✅ Easy Examples

### 1. Constant value:
```javascript
const pi = 3.14;
console.log(pi); // 3.14

// You can't change it later:
// pi = 3.14159; // ❌ This will give an error
```

---

### 2. With an array (list of items):

```javascript
const colors = ["red", "blue"];
colors.push("green"); // ✅ You can add items
console.log(colors); // ["red", "blue", "green"]

// colors = ["yellow"]; // ❌ Not allowed: you can't assign a new array
```

---

### 3. With an object:

```javascript
const user = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };
user.age = 26; // ✅ You can change properties
console.log(user); // { name: "Alice", age: 26 }

// user = { name: "Bob" }; // ❌ Not allowed
```

---

## 💡 When Should Beginners Use `const`?

- When the value **shouldn’t change** (like a name, total, or settings).
- It helps **avoid mistakes** and makes your code easier to read.
