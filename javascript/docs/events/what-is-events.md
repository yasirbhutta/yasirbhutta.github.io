In JavaScript, **events** are actions or occurrences that happen in the browser, often as a result of user interaction. JavaScript can "listen" for these events and respond to them using functions called **event handlers**.

### ðŸ§  Common Examples of Events:
- `click` â€“ When a user clicks on an element.
- `mouseover` â€“ When a user hovers over an element.
- `keydown` â€“ When a user presses a key.
- `submit` â€“ When a form is submitted.
- `load` â€“ When a page or image is loaded.

### ðŸ§ª Example:

```html
<button onclick="sayHello()">Click me</button>

<script>
  function sayHello() {
    alert('Hello!');
  }
</script>
```

This is an example of an **inline event handler**. When the button is clicked, the `sayHello` function runs and shows an alert.

### âœ… A Better Way (Using `addEventListener`)
```html
<button id="myBtn">Click Me</button>

<script>
  document.getElementById("myBtn").addEventListener("click", function() {
    alert("Hello from event listener!");
  });
</script>
```

This is more flexible and preferred in modern JavaScript.
