# Code Optimization in Python

Optimizing Python code can significantly improve performance and resource efficiency. Here are key strategies and techniques:

## 1. Choose the Right Data Structures

```python
# Bad: Searching in a list (O(n))
items = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
if 5 in items:  # Slow for large lists
    pass

# Good: Use sets for membership testing (O(1))
items = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
if 5 in items:  # Much faster
    pass
```

## 2. Use List Comprehensions

```python
# Bad: Traditional loop
result = []
for i in range(100):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        result.append(i*2)

# Good: List comprehension
result = [i*2 for i in range(100) if i % 2 == 0]
```

## 3. Leverage Built-in Functions

```python
# Bad: Manual min/max
min_val = float('inf')
for num in numbers:
    if num < min_val:
        min_val = num

# Good: Built-in min()
min_val = min(numbers)
```

## 4. Avoid Global Variables

```python
# Bad: Using globals
count = 0

def increment():
    global count
    count += 1

# Good: Use locals or class attributes
def increment_counter(counter):
    return counter + 1
```

## 5. String Concatenation

```python
# Bad: + operator in loops
s = ""
for substring in list_of_strings:
    s += substring  # Creates new string each time

# Good: str.join()
s = "".join(list_of_strings)
```

## 6. Memoization/Caching

```python
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def fibonacci(n):
    if n < 2:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```

## 7. Vectorized Operations with NumPy

```python
import numpy as np

# Bad: Python loops
result = [x * 2 for x in large_list]

# Good: NumPy vectorization
arr = np.array(large_list)
result = arr * 2  # Much faster for large arrays
```

## 8. Use Generators for Large Data

```python
# Bad: Loading everything to memory
def read_large_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path) as f:
        return f.readlines()  # Memory intensive

# Good: Generator
def read_large_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path) as f:
        for line in f:
            yield line  # Processes one line at a time
```

## 9. Profile Before Optimizing

```python
import cProfile

def slow_function():
    # Code to profile
    pass

cProfile.run('slow_function()')  # Identify bottlenecks
```

## 10. Use Built-in Libraries

```python
# Bad: Custom CSV parsing
with open('data.csv') as f:
    for line in f:
        fields = line.split(',')

# Good: csv module
import csv
with open('data.csv') as f:
    reader = csv.reader(f)
    for row in reader:
        pass
```

## Advanced Techniques

1. **Cython**: Compile Python to C for performance-critical sections
2. **Multiprocessing**: For CPU-bound tasks (use `multiprocessing` module)
3. **Asyncio**: For I/O-bound tasks with many concurrent operations
4. **Just-In-Time compilation**: With tools like Numba for numerical code

Remember: Always prioritize readability first, then optimize only the bottlenecks identified through profiling.

To optimize code in Python, you should focus on different levels depending on your needs—algorithmic improvements, built-in functions, vectorization, parallelization, and just-in-time compilation.

Here’s a structured approach with examples:


---

1. Algorithm Optimization

Always start with choosing the right algorithm. For example:

# Bad: O(n^2)
for i in range(len(arr)):
    for j in range(i+1, len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == arr[j]:
            return True

# Better: O(n)
seen = set()
for num in arr:
    if num in seen:
        return True
    seen.add(num)


---

2. Use Built-in and Standard Library Functions

Built-ins like sum(), map(), sorted(), min(), and libraries like itertools, collections, heapq, etc., are optimized in C.

# Slower
total = 0
for x in my_list:
    total += x

# Faster
total = sum(my_list)


---

3. Vectorization with NumPy

Avoid loops; use array operations.

# Slower
squared = [x*x for x in arr]

# Faster with NumPy
squared = np.array(arr)**2


---

4. Just-in-Time Compilation with Numba

Numba compiles Python functions to machine code.

from numba import njit

@njit
def compute_modulo(arr_b, arr_c):
    result = []
    for i in range(len(arr_b)):
        b, c = arr_b[i], arr_c[i]
        if b < c:
            result.append(b)
        else:
            result.append(b % c)
    return result


---

5. Multiprocessing / Multithreading

For CPU-bound tasks, use multiprocessing; for IO-bound, use threading or asyncio.

from multiprocessing import Pool

def task(x):
    return x * x

with Pool() as p:
    results = p.map(task, range(1000000))


---

6. Profiling

Use these to find slow parts of your code:

cProfile

line_profiler

timeit

memory_profiler
