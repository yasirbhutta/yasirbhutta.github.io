### **Intermediate Level Tasks**
4. **Combined Operations**
   - Given `mixed = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date', 'elderberry', 'fig']`:
     - Extract fruits from 2nd to 2nd last (inclusive)
     - Get alternate items starting from the 2nd item
     - Reverse the middle 3 items

5. **Modification Tasks**
   - Start with `original = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`:
     - Replace elements 2-4 with [20, 30, 40]
     - Insert [0, 0] after every existing element (result: [1,0,0,2,0,0,...])
     - Remove every 2nd element

### **Challenge Tasks**
6. **String Manipulation**
   - For `text = "PythonProgramming"`:
     - Extract "Python" and "Programming" separately
     - Get every 3rd character in reverse order
     - Create a palindrome by combining the string with its reverse

7. **Real-world Scenario**
   - Process `temperatures = [72, 75, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90]`:
     - Extract all temperatures above 80
     - Get temperatures between 75 and 85
     - Reverse the list and get every 2nd day's temperature
