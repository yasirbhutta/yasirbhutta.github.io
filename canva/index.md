### What is Sharing and Collaboration?

In Canva, sharing and collaboration are features that allow you to work with others on your designs. 

**Sharing:**

Sharing your designs in Canva gives you control over how others can interact with your work. You can grant them different permission levels:

**View only:** This is the most restrictive option, and it allows viewers to see the design but not make any changes. It's a good choice for presentations or sharing drafts for feedback.

**Comment:** Viewers with this permission can see the design and leave comments with suggestions or questions directly on the design. This is a great way to gather input from others without giving them editing control.

**Edit:** This permission level allows viewers to make changes to the design itself. It's ideal for collaborative projects where multiple people need to contribute to the final product.

**Collaboration:**

* This takes sharing a step further, allowing you to work on a design with others in real-time. 
* You can invite people to edit your design using their email addresses.
* Everyone with editing access can see changes made by others as they happen.
* Collaboration features also include:
    * **Commenting and suggesting:** Leave feedback directly on the design for others to see.
    * **Version history:** Track changes made to the design and revert to previous versions if needed.

**Benefits of Sharing and Collaboration:**

* Get feedback and improve your designs from others.
* Combine the creative strengths of different people.
* Work on projects together, even if you're not in the same location.

## Review Questions

1. What is a Canva Template, and what are its key features?
2. What are the main purposes of using the Elements tab in Canva?
3. Can you differentiate between free and premium elements in the Elements tab? How?
   
**Answer:**

There are two key ways to tell free elements apart from premium elements in Canva's Elements tab:

1. **Look for the crown symbol:**  Free elements will have a simple icon, while premium elements will be marked with a small crown (♛) in the bottom right corner. This crown signifies that a license fee is required to use the element.

2. **Hover over the element:** When you hover your cursor over an element, a small tooltip appears. This tooltip will display information about the element, including whether it's free or a premium element. It'll simply say "Free" or have a crown icon (♛) next to it.

By using these methods, you can easily identify which elements are free to use and which ones require a purchase or a Canva Pro/Teams subscription for unlimited access.
